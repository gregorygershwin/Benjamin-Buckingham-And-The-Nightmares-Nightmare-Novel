<h1 id="chapter01">Chapter 1: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Nightmare</h1>

<p>Benjamin tossed and turned in bed, unable to get himself into a deep sleep. He went through all of the usual routines to prepare himself for a night of dreaming about dinosaurs. He counted the number of figurines in his room. One hundred and forty-seven. He studied the skeletons of his favorite dinosaur, the tyrannosaurus rex. And, he even replayed his dreams from the previous five nights in his head. But, nothing was happening.</p>

<p>He stood up from the bed and looked at it accusingly. There must be something wrong with it. Benjamin gave the mattress a kick to the side as he would give his computer when it started to make peculiar noises. The bed did not move and it did not seem to fix his problem.</p>

<p>From his backpack, he retrieved that empty dream journal that Mr. Marchetta, his elementary school teacher, had given his class to record their dreams for one week. It was the same type of journal that he was given to record the foods he ate during a week, the birds he saw during a week, and the number of times Jupiter, Benjamin's golden retriever, jumped into the ground floor family swimming pool from the second floor balcony. Six times. Jupiter jumped six times. Benjamin was convinced that Mr. Marchetta had billions of these empty journals sitting in his classroom closets.</p>

<p>He paced back and forth in his bedroom. He turned on his computer and set the volume low enough so that the noise would not wake his parents. He navigated the internet until he found <i>Jurassic Superheroes</i> episodes, a popular television series in which a group of good dinosaurs destroy Professor Undutois' plans to destroy the world. Professor Undutois was the worst kind of villian, in Benjamin's mind, because he was smart and mean. That combination made Benjamin very uncomfortable. Benjamin's favorite episode was the one that his mother felt was too violent. Buildings fell down. Dinosaurs tumbled everywhere. Cars exploded. Benjamin's mother hated it. Benjamin, however, loved it. He clicked play and watched the scenes unfold, wishing he could join the dinosaurs in their quest to stop bad people.</p>

<p>The dinosaurs were flying in an airplane when they saw a newsflash that Professor Undutois was going to decimate a large metropolis by blasting it with a gigantic blue laser. One of the dinosaurs knew that it would take at least fifteen minutes until Professor Undutois could start his evil plan. They needed to land the plane immediately and find the terrible man's location before it was too late for all of the innocent people living in the millions of apartments clustered together like a concrete beehive.</p>

<p>Benjamin watched the dinosaurs ride their motorcycles between cars and trucks along a crowded highway, their eyes focused on an evil trailer in the distance. Suddenly, the backdoor of the trailer opened and Professor Undutois began throwing boulders at the dinosaurs. They dodged left and right and Benjamin's heart, which normally began racing during this scene, stayed very, very steady. He had seen the dinosaurs destroy Professor Undutois' plans thousands of times and he knew their lines, strategies, and characters as well as he knew himself. As the dinosaurs steered closer to Professor Undutois, Benjamin's eyelids began to close and his memory took over.</p>

<p>The dinosaurs drove next to Professor Undutois' trailer causing the evil villain to brake suddenly and turn sharply off the highway into the European streets below. Benjamin and the dinosaurs chased after him, Benjamin leading the way on a green bicycle. He passed old coffee shops with women drinking espresso and dodged pedestrians carrying baguettes and swerved around taxis transporting people on these Parisian streets while keeping his eye on Professor Undutois in the distance. Benjamin knew exactly where his nemesis had stationed his laser; it was positioned at the top of the Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>Benjamin stopped chasing Professor Undutois and instead started racing toward the large metal structure in the middle of Paris. The Eiffel Tower was only a quarter mile away as darkness suddenly overcame the city, sending Benjamin's heart into a fast pace. Professor Undutois was nearly at the destination and Benjamin thought, for a moment, that he would not be able to stop him from doing harm. As soon as he started to doubt himself, he realized that if he did not stop Professor Undutois, no one would. He took a deep breath and tried to find courage. As thunder and lightning overwhelmed Paris, Benjamin ran to the Eiffel Tower and began to ascend it to the top.</p>

<p>But then, Professor Undutois came down from Eiffel Tower and ran away as fast as he could, his arms flailing as he screamed loudly. Benjamin stood confused because his dreams never ended this way. Professor Undutois was never scared or worried. He was always confident and mean. He was running away from something, Benjamin realized.</p>

<p>When Benjamin looked to the top of the Eiffel Tower, he saw gigantic figure that bellowed so loudly that Benjamin could feel the growl pulse through his tiny body. It was the scariest creature Benjamin had ever seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, it's time to wake up,&#8221; Mrs. Buckingham said as she opened Benjamin's door on her way downstairs to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Benjamin woke up and stared at his computer. He knew something was wrong with how he woke up. He pinched himself and rubbed his eyes over and over to make sure that he was indeed awake. He was but he didn't feel awake.</p>

<p>In all of the dreams he ever had, there was never an evil villain other than Professor Undutois. What could be more evil than Professor Undutois, Benjamin wondered. Is there something more evil out there?</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin!&#8221; Mrs. Buckingham yelled from the kitchen.</p>

<p>Benjamin ran downstairs and pondered what had just happened over french toast. Mr. Buckingham was holding the newspaper with a headline <i>DREAMS HAVE All BUT DISAPPEARED IN PENNSYLVANIA</i>. Benjamin read it and wondered if he had lost the ability to dream. If last night foretold the future, Benjamin, too, would not be able to dream like he had in the past. On his way to school, he continued to think about the monster. He wondered if there was something in one of the <i>Jurassic Superheroes</i> episodes that he was misremembering. He knew them completely, though, so it was just not possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Tuesday, I dreamed that I was at dinner with my parents when my brother spilled lasagna. It was going to fall on our dog but I saved her just in time,&#8221; one of Benjamin's classmates said in front of everyone. The classroom was sparsely decorated and dimly lit, as school rooms were that did not have a lot of money. Each of his classmates was reading from their dream journals and Benjamin was beginning to think that he might be teased if everyone knew that he had just awoken from a nightmare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howard,&#8221; Mr. Marchetta read from a list on his desk. &#8220;You're next. Please read your dreams to the class.&#8221;</p>

<p>Howard Horne, a child who looked and behaved like a bully, walked to the front of the class with his journal, smirking at Benjamin along the way. He cleared his throat arrogantly. Benjamin rolled his eyes, wishing Howard would embarrass himself in front of everyone. Instead, Howard started to detail dreams that everyone in the class thought were exciting and thrilling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a gladiator Wednesday night and there was a dragon that had invaded our school,&#8221; Howard said as he clenched the journal with one hand and pointed to his classmates with the other. &#8220;The dragon was here to destroy us. It was going to destroy all of us. It blew fire everywhere and the school started to burn. This wasn't so bad but I was not going to let the dragon destroy our houses. And, the baseball field. I ran after it and then I destroyed the dragon using my gladiator shield and gladiator sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>The class applauded and Benjamin participated, weakly, so that he did not draw attention to himself. He wanted to fit in. The last thing he wanted was to be different from everyone else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, you're next,&#8221; Mr. Marchetta said as Howard Horne walked to his seat.</p>

<p>Benjamin gulped. His dreams were not nearly as courageous and none of the characters in his dreams were people who he knew in real life. They were his friends, he believed, but they were, indeed, dinosaurs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, come on,&#8221; Mr. Marchetta said because Benjamin had not yet moved.</p>

<p>He walked to the front of the class with his journal in his left hand and a worried state in his mind. And just like he did in his dreams when he was losing confidence that he might not be able to stop Professor Undutois, he took one big breath to stop his worries.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other day I dreamed that I was with a group of dinosaurs in Honolulu. The evil villain Professor Undutois was going to start a volcano that would destroy the entire island. I led the dinosaurs up the volcano and found Professor Undutois and his evil machine. I went up to him and said--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's an episode!&#8221; Howard Horne yelled from the back of the class.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howard, quiet,&#8221; Mr. Marchetta interjected.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's not a dream!&#8221; Howard said with a laugh. &#8220;That's the tenth episode of <i>Jurassic Superheroes</i> and we're too old to be watching that anymore. <i>Jurassic Superheroes</i>is for little kids, Benjamin. You should go down the hall and tell it to the kindergarteners. But they probably won't be impressed because you can't even dream your own dreams! You steal from television shows!&#8221;</p>

<p>The entire class started to laugh as Benjamin's face turned red. It was an episode of that popular television series but it also happened to be his dream. He didn't know what to do next so he continued to stare into his journal in hope that time would move much faster than it was. He had lost any confidence that the deep breath had given him. And, he did not know how to get it back. All he knew was that he didn't want to be there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, you can continue,&#8221; Mr. Marchetta said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think I should,&#8221; Benjamin said nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Mr. Marchetta said. &#8220;But, that will mean you still have to complete your assignment. You can't disguise television episodes as your dreams. If you don't have a dream, just say that you didn't have a dream. Don't lie about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't lie,&#8221; Benjamin said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet I've already seen all of your dreams on television,&#8221; Howard said over the laughter of all the other kids in the classroom. &#8220;I bet I know the endings too!&#8221;</p>

<p> Benjamin stared out the window into the parking lot for the remainder of the day. He didn't know why school needed to be so difficult. Why was it so hard to make friends?</p>

<p>For dinner, Mr. Buckingham made waffles topped with fruit because it was his favorite meal and because he had decided that the family did not consume enough waffles. Benjamin did not have any complaints but he was distracted by everything he gone through that day. He had dreamed a nightmare and then lived through one in the classroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had to read through our dream journal at school today,&#8221; Benjamin began, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's great,&#8221; Mrs. Buckingham responded as she set the table. &#8220;How did it go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Mr. Buckingham said as he continued to make waffles.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of my dreams are creative. I'm not creative. My dreams aren't dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure they are. You told me all about those dinosaur dreams,&#8221; his dad continued. &#8220;And, frankly, I don't know how anyone would think that they weren't creative. It takes a lot of creativity to imagine a stegasauraus navigating a sailboat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it's just that they aren't my dreams. They're all from<i> Jurassic Superheroe</i>s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you watching that episode I told you not to watch?&#8221; his mother asked as she handed him a napkin.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but all my dreams star me and I go around with the dinosaurs stopping Professor Undutois.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are great dreams!&#8221; his dad continued while making more waffles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we have enough waffles,&#8221; Mrs. Buckingham whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten more?&#8221; he asked quickly. &#8220;Did you know that I haven't had a dream in months. I couldn't tell you the last dream I've had. I'd love to have a dream where I am parading around with dinosaurs solving crimes. I feel like most people these days can't dream. There was a time when everyone had dreams and now it's all gone. You should be thrilled to have dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, all the other kids in school have dreams that are much different than mine. I want my dreams to be like their dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Different is good. You should be glad you're different. One day, you might regret that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm thinking about throwing away the dinosaur posters in my room,&#8221; Benjamin said to his parents .</p>

<p>Mr. Buckingham put down the waffle maker and Mrs. Buckingham stopped setting the table. They were surprised with Benjamin. He had not thought about it for very long but he had decided that by getting rid of the dinosaurs in his room, he would begin to have different dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about this,&#8221; Mr. Buckingham continued slowly. &#8220;You keep all the dinosaur stuff in your room for a month. If you don't have a creative dream in a month, we'll redesign your room to something else. Maybe sports? Cars?&#8221; Mr. Buckingham paused and looked at Mrs. Buckingham briefly. &#8220;Girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Buckingham rolled her eyes at Benjamin's dad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you've had a bad day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But the great thing about having a bad day is that the next day is always better. &#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who wants some waffles?&#8221; Mr. Buckingham asked with four enormous plates of waffles topped with very little fruit.</p>

<p>The television was playing in the family room and an emergency alert appeared at the bottom of a news television show: <i>IN THIS ECONOMY, WE CAN NO LONGER DREAM....</i> Great, Benjamin thought. Nightmares are everywhere.</p>  






















<h1 id="chapter02">Chapter 2: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Actually Is A Dinosaur</h1>

<p>That night, Benjamin dreamt that he was meeting the dinosaurs at a castle to discuss Professor Undutois' plan to destroy another European capital by flooding it. Benjamin had to figure out where his evil nemesis was going to access enough water to execute the plan. He and the dinosaurs looked down from Prague's castle to the river below.</p>

<p>There just isn't enough water there to flood the entire city, Benjamin thought to himself. There was no ocean or lake nearby. If Professor Undutois was going to bring in a vast amount of water, Benjamin would be able to see it from the castle. He rubbed his brow as the stegosaurus, tyrannosaurus rex, and brontosaurus waited to hear the plan. Benjamin was confused because he could not figure out where the water would come from.</p>

<p>And then, he had his answer. The sky was clear. It was crystal blue. But in the distance, there was an unusually lonely cloud floating in the direction of the city</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Undutois is going to make it rain upon Prague until the city is underwater,&#8221; he proclaimed to the seated dinosaurs. &#8220;We have to find the machine he built to create rain and stop him before it's too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does the machine look like?&#8221; the tyrannosaurus rex asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not exactly sure,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;But, it has to be large enough to produce big clouds. it had to be near that cloud over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>All of the dinosaurs looked in the direction Benjamin was pointing and agreed that his conclusion made perfect sense. They watched another cloud appear from the distance. Then, another. And, another. There was no doubt in Benjamin's mind that Professor Undutois was making rain clouds and that the evil nemesis would continue to do so until Prague was underwater.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let's get him!&#8221; Benjamin shouted to his friends.</p>

<p>They raced down Prague Castle and through the old city, navigating the roads on bicycles so that they could dodge the trolleys quickly and safely. Benjamin's heart beat faster as he realized that this beautiful city could be lost if he didn't stop Professor Undutois. It was a lot of pressure, he thought, but he would do it with the assistance of his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we should go--&#8221; Benjamin started.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm hungry,&#8221; the brontosaurus yelled back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you be hungry now? Can't you wait until after we arrest Professor Undutois?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I'm pretty hungry,&#8221; the brontosaurus named Gary added. &#8220;I think I need to eat or I'm not going to be able to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is anyone else hungry like Gary?&#8221; Benjamin asked his friends while standing in the middle of Wenceles Square. He couldn't believe this. He needed the dinosaurs to help him and all they were concerned about was eating more food.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could use a nap,&#8221; the tyrannosaurus rex named Snark said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nap!&#8221; Benjamin shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we've been going pretty fast for quite some time. I'm kind of tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we don't have time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won't be a long nap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I start now, I think it could be fifteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gary came back with a gigantic salad and began eating it on a park bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, Snark. Get some sleep,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;Gerald and I will find a way to get to Professor Undutois so that we don't lose much time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Actually, I kind of have to...,&#8221; Gerald the stegosaurus paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Use the restroom,&#8221; Gerald whispered into Benjamin's ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; Benjamin said as he flung his hands to his side. He gave up. &#8220;Go use the bathroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerald stumbled away from the group, Snark slept on the ground, and Gary ate on the parkbench. Benjamin was sure that he was losing valuable time that should have been spent stopping the terrible man. He turned his head to the sky and noticed that there were more than ten clouds in the sky. It was only a matter of time before the sky was covered with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think I can wait much longer,&#8221; Benjamin said to Gary. &#8220;I need to go stop Professor Undutois.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll only be a few more minutes,&#8221; Gary said as he chewed on some carrots. &#8220;But, I kind of have to use the bathroom as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going to go,&#8221; Benjamin decided as he gained more confidence. &#8220;When Snark wakes up and Gerald returns, find me where Professor Undutois is creating the clouds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds good, Ben,&#8221; Gary replied while eating broccoli.</p>

<p>Benjamin did not like the idea of abandoning his friends but he also did not like the idea of Professor Undutois flooding Prague. He thought that he would find the villain and when the dinosaurs were ready, they would help him then.</p>

<p>More clouds gathered in the sky, and then Benjamin felt a raindrop. It was the first raindrop he felt and so he was not very nervous. Then, he felt another, and then another. Professor Undutois was well underway with his plan and Benjamin needed to stop him quickly. If the rain continued at this pace, there could be a flood very soon.</p>

<p>Benjamin found an abandoned bicycle and rode it to the cloud machine. He saw the object on the top of a small apartment building. But, he could not see Professor Undutois.</p>

<p>Clouds scattered themselves across the sky and the rain began to pour more violently. Benjamin climbed a ladder on the side of the apartment building, careful not to slip on the metal steps. When he reached the rooftop, he saw the machine. But, he also saw that the buttons to control it were missing. Professor Undutois had them, he thought to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You'll never stop me this time, Benjamin,&#8221; Professor Undutois yelled from the rooftop across the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the controls,&#8221; Benjamin said sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In your dreams,&#8221; Professor Undutois said.</p>

<p>Benjamin did not believe he could turn off the machine without obtaining the controls that Professor Undutois held. As the rain started to pour more violently, he climbed back down the apartment building and raced across the street. He was about to ascend the staircase when he saw Professor Undutois began descending the same staircase, heading right for Benjamin. Benjamin took a step backwards and prepared himself to tackle the evil villain as soon as he was within reach. This would be Benjamin's most successful victory yet.</p>

<p>Oddly, though, Professor Undutois was screaming. He was screaming so loudly that Benjamin realized the villain was not running toward Benjamin but away from something. Professor Undutois landed on the ground, threw the controls for the cloud machine at Benjamin, and then ran down the street with his arms above his head, panicking more and more.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked in the direction from which Professor Undutois came and saw the top of the staircase was beginning to shake. There was no time to lose, though, because Benjamin needed to stop the clouds. He looked at the controls that Professor Undutois had thrown at him and decided that it would be simple enough to stop the rain. Benjamin lowered his index finger onto the OFF button when bricks started to fall from the side of the apartment building. Benjamin looked to the roof and saw the most gigantic face of a monster he had ever seen.</p>

<p>It was the same monster.</p>

<p>It screamed at Benjamin more loudly than any noise Benjamin had ever heard previously.</p>

<p>It displayed teeth that were like enormous swords.</p>

<p>It emanated fire from its body as if it was a moving volcano.</p>

<p>And, it moved slowly towards Benjamin.</p>

<p>Benjamin did not know what to do in this situation because he had never encountered such a thing before. If he turned off the rain, he thought, the episode would be over and he will have won. His finger clicked the OFF button on the controls and the clouds stopped appearing and the rain stopped falling and Prague stopped being flooded. But, the monster kept moving toward Benjamin.</p>

<p>It jumped to the street level, destroying the cars and trucks that it landed upon. Benjamin realized that this monster was after him. And, Benjamin could not hide his fear. His legs shaked. His arms felt numb. His muscles felt immobile. His face felt weak.</p>

<p>And then, he felt a painful thud in the side of his body. He looked to the ground and realized that he was moving, but his legs were still and his body was still. Snark had grabbed him and ran faster than Benjamin had ever seen him run before. The monster began to chase and Snark sprinted more quickly down deserted streets heading for a section of the city that Benjamin had not seen before.</p>

<p>Benjamin panicked and did not enjoy the dream anymore. He felt in danger and he felt that his friends, the dinosaurs, recognized that there was indeed something wrong. Benjamin wanted to leave, so he did.</p>

<p>He woke up.</p>

<p>He rubbed his eyes and stretched his arms and remarked how his heart was racing a little bit more than he was comfortable with.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's over,&#8221; he thought to himself, disappointed that he did have a successful dream and curious as to why that monster appeared again.</p>

<p>Benjamin threw his legs over the side of the bed and although he was still waking up, he realized that something was not quite right. Whenever he looked to his wall, his eyes were inline with the poster of a stegosaurus. But now, his eyes were well above the poster. In fact, his head was only a foot away from the ceiling. Benjamin looked down and realized that he was almost six feet above the ground. And if he was six feet above the ground, there was something holding his bed six feet in the air.</p>

<p>He jumped to the floor, looked under his bed and screamed. There was a dinosaur who looked exactly like Snark. The dinosaur looked at Benjamin and screamed in return.</p>

<p>Benjamin screamed.</p>

<p>Snark screamed.</p>

<p>Benjamin panicked.</p>

<p>Snark panicked.</p>

<p>Benjamin tried to run away.</p>

<p>Snark tried to run away.</p>

<p>Benjamin wanted to exit the room but Snark was standing in the path to the door. As Benjamin moved to one side, Snark moved to that same side in an awkward dance of two very scared creatures. And then, Snark grabbed Benjamin by his shoulders.</p>

<p>The only thought that passed through Benjamin's mind was that he was going to be eaten at that moment. It was inevitable. Snark was probably hungry and Benjamin was food. But if I'm going to be eaten, Benjamin thought, I'm going to run away and hide. And since he couldn't move, he fought the only way he knew how to fight; he spat into Snark's eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, gross!&#8221; Snark replied as he dropped Benjamin and rubbed the left side of his face. &#8220;Gross!&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice sounded a lot less menacing than Benjamin had expected. It sounded like it belonged to a man older than Benjamin but not as old as his dad. It sounded as if it was from someone who was not a kid but not yet an adult. Benjamin stepped backward slowly to the door so that he could escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going to get in so much trouble for this!&#8221; Snark said as he sat heavily upon Benjamin's chest of dinosaur toys, denting the lid quite significantly. Snark waved one of his claws against his face to brush away some dust in his eye. &#8220;Come on, Rodney. Pull yourself together. You can do this.&#8221; Snark took a deep, long breath. &#8220;You can do this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney?&#8221; Benjamin asked with curiosity.</p>

<p>Snark turned quickly to Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Benjamin,&#8221; Snark said. &#8220;You need to go about your day and when you come back to your room tonight, I'll be gone. Actually, it would be really, really great if you didn't tell anyone that I'm here. Can you do that for me? I mean, I'm really, really trying hard to keep this job and I'm really, really close to losing it. I need you to do a big favor for me and not tell anyone that I was here. Otherwise, I'll lose my job. Is that OK?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What's your job?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I keep talking and I get myself into more trouble,&#8221; Snark continued as he shook his head. &#8220;I can't tell you that, Benjamin. I've said too much. You just have to promise me that you're not going to tell anyone that I'm here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's kind of hard,&#8221; Benjamin responded. &#8220;You've destroyed my room and you're making so much noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Snark and Benjamin looked at the room which appeared to have been torn apart by a tornado, the posters and toys strewn across the floor. The bed was almost unusable and there was clothing everywhere. The lamps were knocked over and there were gigantic tyrannosaurus rex footprints throughout, including the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin!&#8221; Mrs. Buckingham yelled up the stairs. &#8220;Stop jumping around up there and come down for breakfast!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need to clean this up,&#8221; Benjamin said to Snark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't clean it up,&#8221; the dinosaur responded to Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You made this mess! You clean it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I can't.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I've got these tiny arms. It'll take me weeks to clean up and I need to get back to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Work? What do you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I can't tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you're an accountant too, like my dad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, I'm sorry I destroyed your room but I have to go and I need you not to tell anyone that I was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Benjamin said with a little anger at the state of his space. &#8220;But, you're going to have to go out through the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The window!&#8221; Snark yelled with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;If my mom sees a dinosaur was in my room, I'm going to be in even bigger trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not going out the window!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Is it the arms again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that's not how I can leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You've destroyed my room and now you're going to run around my home. Do you know what the kids at school are going to say about me when they find out a dinosaur came from my room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, I know. I'm going to leave quickly but I can't let you know how I'm going to leave. You just need to step into the hallway for one minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you steal any of my toys,&#8221; Benjamin began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not going to steal any of your toys!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or the posters!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not going to steal any of your posters!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just, please, Benjamin, I'm going to get into so much trouble. I'm really late. I need to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Benjamin said as he gave one last frustrated look to Snark. He stepped into the hallway and closed the door, but only until there was a tiny sliver through which he could see what Snark was going to do next.</p>

<p>Benjamin watched Snark walk back and forth with his claws on his head, obviously worried about the state of things. He kept looking at his wrist, upon which Benjamin realized was a watch. He had not noticed it earlier. Maybe Snark really was late for something, Benjamin thought. Curiosity was overwhelming him and he wanted to know where Snark was going next. Dinosaurs did not just walk around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Snark took one more glance at his watch and rubbed his claws together. He grabbed the side of the bed and stood it up on its side. Benjamin couldn't believe what he was watching. Snark was making more of a mess of his room even after promising that he wouldn't. It would take him months to restore it to a state his mother would find acceptable, Benjamin thought.</p>

<p>And then, a bright light appeared on the floor that had been previously hidden by the bed. It became larger and larger and brighter and brighter. Snark shielded his eyes and Benjamin did the same. And without saying anything to Benjamin, Snark jumped into the light in the ground as if it was a swimming pool and disappeared.</p>

<p>Benjamin's mind was overwhelmed with thoughts. Where was Snark going? How long had there been this light under his bed? Where did it go? Who was going to clean up this mess? How mad will his mother be?</p>

<p>He opened the door to his room and stepped to the light, peering as closely to it as he could without falling into it. He couldn't see anything beyond brightness. And then, the circular light started to get smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>More thoughts entered Benjamin's mind as he realized that a door to something was closing. He did not know what was on the other side of the door but he did know that there was a dinosaur who was late for something. And, that dinosaur knew Benjamin's name. And, that dinosaur saved his life. He struggled with what he should do next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, time for school!&#8221; Mrs. Buckingham yelled to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;School!&#8221; Benjamin echoed to himself.</p>

<p>But, I don't want to go to school today, he thought to himself.</p>

<p>And so, he jumped.</p>




















<h1 id="chapter03">Chapter 3: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Lost Child</h1>

<p>Benjamin could not believe a space could be a dark as this was. He couldn't see anything. He didn't know what was ahead of him, what was behind him, what was beside him, or what was above him. There was darkness everywhere.</p>

<p>Benjamin didn't want to move, in case one step to his left led him to a five thousand foot fall off a mountain with rocks and trees and other sharp things ready to knock into his little body along the way. If he took one step forward, he might step onto some old wooden platform that could give way to him falling six thousand feet into an ancient gold mining shaft. If he took one step backwards, he might step get his foot tangled into a rope that had been placed to catch large animals like dinosaurs and suddenly he would be pulled seven thousand feet into the air, dangling from some magnificent tree. He leaned a little bit the left and then decided that taking a step to the left would be just as bad. If he took a step to the left, as opposed to the right, he might step into the opening of a gigantic volcano eight thousand feet tall, his tiny body flailing and falling into the erupting lava below.</p>

<p>He worried that if he jumped, the land on which he currently stood might suddenly disappear. Benjamin realized that he was worrying too much. He was losing control of his thoughts as everything he imagined was bad. Benjamin sat on the ground and wished that his mind would wander into the many glorious things that might await him when the darkness faded. But, he couldn't. There was no good to being alone in darkness, he thought.</p>

<p>And then, something touched him. He felt it fly by his back as quickly as a bat or bird. If it was just a bird, that would be fine because Benjamin had seen many birds before. But if it was a bat, Benjamin would be more concerned. He had never seen one before. He would rather see something he knew than something he didn't know.</p>

<p>It touched him again. This time, he felt the creature across his left shoulder. Benjamin cowered down lower to the ground.</p>

<p>And then, it touched him twice, this time on both the left and right shoulders. Benjamin kept still and hoped that he could be invisible in the darkness.</p>

<p>At that point, the touching didn't stop. More and more, Benjamin felt the annoying bird-bat thing hitting him. Whatever it was could see in the dark, he thought.</p>

<p>Benjamin began to flail his arms in front of him to ward off the flying thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Away! Away, demon bird!&#8221; Benjamin yelled at whatever it was that was bothering him.</p>

<p>But then, Benjamin could see in the dark, too. At a distance of about thirty feet away, a tiny candle suddenly lit to reveal that there was no volcano, mountain, mine shaft, or dinosaur traps around him. There was only flat, safe ground so Benjamin jumped to his feet and ran to the light. He examined it and saw that it was on top of a wooden pole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light!&#8221; Benjamin said with excitement.<p>

<p>Without thinking about who turned the light on, he grabbed the torch and slowly illuminatd everything around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh. Shadows!&#8221; Benjamin said with far less excitement.</p>

<p>Shadows of various sizes were moving at high speeds all around him. They looked like creatures with two, three, four, eight, and eleven limbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsters!&#8221; Benjamin yelled.</p>

<p>As if it heard him, another light flickered on to his left. Benjamin ran to it and noticed that it, too, was on a wooden stake. He did not see anyone or anything around that could have turned it on. He only saw more shadows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away, dinosaurs! Snark, help me!&#8221; Benjamin yelled.</p>

<p>Dozens candles suddenly flickered on, as if Snark was listening to his requet for help. They revealed a path through the darkness. Without concern for the shadows and bird-bats, Benjamin ran through the path as fast as he could. He passed nearly fifteen candles when the dark environment changed completely. Everywhere, without warning, was light. And for the first time, Benjamin saw where he was.</p>

<p>He was standing at the entrance to a large stadium with tens of thousands of people in the stands cheering and screaming. The audience surrounded a circular ground covered with sandy dirt that felt hot under the blue sky and unforgiving sun. In the middle of this arena stood a gladiator, with a shield the size of his body and a sword twice as long. He pounded the sword into his shield and screamed back at the crowd. The crowd screamed back at the gladiator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Today!&#8221; the gladiator beckons. &#8220;We will no longer be afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin was immediately afraid. The candles that he had only earlier followed to his current situation fell to the ground. He realized he was previously standing in the middle of the gladiator's arena.</p>

<p>The audience of thousands jumped as the gladiator gestured every direction, including a momentary glance directly at Benjamin. Benjamin slowly walked backwards and hid behind a door from which he could observe without being seen.</p>

<p>The gladiator ran around the arena waving a huge flag three stories high of blue, yellow, and orange colors. The crowd loved every moment of it. Many  threw flowers upon the ground. Many waved signs with pictures of the gladiator on them. Others whistled loudly.</p>

<p>As the gladiator returned to the center of the stadium, thunder broke out in the distance. The gladiator looked in the direction of the noise and raised both his shield and sword into the air. The crowd erupted in excitement for reasons Benjamin did not understand.</p>

<p>Thunder clapped again, closer to the arena. The gladiator yelled back and the audience erupted again.</p>

<p>Thunder clapped once more and Benjamin realized it was not thunder at all. He saw it land with a earthquake thud. It was a monstrous, skinny red dragon breathing fire into the bright blue sky.</p>

<p>The heroic gladiator grabbed the dragon by its tail and swung it around and around until he got dizzy. He ran to the beast's head and wrapped the dragon's jaw with thick rope, preventing it from doing any harm to anyone. The audience loved every moment of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our land!&#8221; the gladiator yelled as he directed the dragon to fly away.</p>

<p>Benjamin's eyes were wide and his jaw was low. He did not know where he was but if there were dinosaurs, gladiators, and dragons, he decided that he made the correct decision to skip school that day.</p>

<p>As he leaned forward to try to get a better view of the gladiator flying the dragon around the arena, something brushed his shoulders again. But this time, it clasped him and did not let go. Benjamin was pulled backwards by something he couldn't see.</p>   



















<h1 id="chapter04">Chapter 4: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A King</h1>

<p>&#8220;Welcome!&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn yelled to Benjamin in a large stately room. &#8220;You had a very close call there! Where are you from? I'm so glad you started walking toward those candles. You would've been squashed by that gladiator. Or even worse, you would have been eaten by that dragon!&#8221;</p>

<p>King Bernard Zwirn held his heavy belly and let out a loud, echoing chuckle. It was such a bellowing, full laugh that it made Benajmin smile. Benjamin felt more relaxed in front of this gentle, warm grandfatherly man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where am I?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Benjamin, are in Ehtahl Castle and I am King Bernard Zwirn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king stretched his arms wide as he could. Everything around him looked beautiful and grand. There were stately statues and ornate paintings and healthy plants throughout this castle's hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the first visitor we've ever had from the outside,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Outside?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! No one from where you're from has ever been here. We take great pride in our secrecy and our secret location. It's a wonder you found us at all. But now that you're here, I'd like to offer you a key to the castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn turned from Benjamin and ran down the hall like a rhinoceros running through a gorgeous, pristine setting. The pictures shook, the candles bounced, and Benjamin thought for a moment that the king was not as graceful as he was portraying himself to be. Bernard Zwirn rummaged through dozens of chests at the end of the hall, throwing clothes and boxes and other ancient artifacts behind him as he desperately searched for the key.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's in here somewhere!&#8221; he yelled to Benjamin as he turned a large trunk upside down and sorted through its contents.</p>

<p>Benjamin knew his mother would not be happy with the manner in which Bernard Zwirn was searching. The previously beautiful grand hall was becoming a messy large room. There were things everywhere and it would take several days to put everything back together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he passed a small box to Benjamin. &#8220;You have a key to my castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tiny silver box with a gold ribbon looked as extraordinary as anything else around him. Benjamin unwrapped it quickly, tossing the paper to the ground, and opened the lid.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a grasshopper!&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A grasshopper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, Benjamin,&#8221; Benard Zwirn chuckled again. &#8220;Grasshopper are little insects. Keys open doors and they certainly aren't alive. They're quite different things, keys and grasshoppers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, look, King Zwirn. It's a grasshopper,&#8221; Benjamin said as he offered the box back to Bernard Zwirn.</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn looked inside and saw that there was indeed a grasshopper living in the box.</p>

<p>&#8220;The grasshopper ate the key!&#8221; Bernard Zwirn yelled accusingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think a grasshopper can eat at key,&#8221; Benjamin responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a key in here and now there is a grasshopper. That can only mean that the grasshopper ate the key,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he scolded the grasshopper. &#8220;There can be no other explanation!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was the key smaller than the grasshopper?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a huge key. It was much larger than this grasshopper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, there's no way the grasshopper can eat the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know so much about grasshoppers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a lot of them in my backyard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have grasshoppers in Ehtsetra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ehtsetra?&#8221; Benjamin asked with a puzzled face.</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn looked at the grasshopper and then leaned in to Benjamin, his face contorted in confusion. He looked around the room quickly, as if he was unsure if anyone was watching him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, you are a visitor to this castle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a visitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Ehtsetra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you are not from Ehtsetra, where may I ask are you from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said very, very slowly. He stepped away with incredibly long, drawn out strides. Benjamin could sense that the grasshopper was nervous because it had stopped gnawing on the side of the box. Bernard Zwirn looked at Benjamin from the corner of his eye and continued to move further and further away. &#8220;If you'll excuse me, I have to--.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that, Bernard Zwirn sprinted away with his arms waving over his head, his feet slipping on the blue carpet. Benjamin never heard an adult scream as loudly as Bernard Zwirn did. The faces in the paintings appeared to squirm with discomfort over the dreadful noise.</p>

<p>Benjamin sighed. If he wasn't being nice, he would expect people to run away from him screaming. But given the circumstances, Benjamin did not understand what he was doing wrong. What was so wrong about being from Pennsylvania? And, where was Ehtsetra anyways?</p>

<p>If he doesn't want to be friends with me, he thought to himself, I'll just explore on my own.</p>

<p>There were more paintings of people on the walls than Benjamin could count. There was Sir Laborious Maximus who looked like an Italian painter with an absurdly long mustache. There was Queen Jebra Coolihan whose head was four times larger than the rest of her body. There was a dog named Woolfred Woofery who looked more brave than all of the other people in the paintings. And then there was a tiny plaque for Aloysius Trenhaile but there was no painting. Instead, the words <i>We don't talk about it</i> were inscribed in the wall above his name. Benjamin found this intriguing but did not have more time to think about it because Bernard Zwirn reappeared.</p>

<p>With Bernard Zwirn, a security guard who was as short as he was wide arrived. He looked like a cube with tiny little feet and short red hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, get the monster!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn yelled. Benjamin realized that the king was referring to him, that he was the monster.</p>

<p>Noel charged at Benjamin as if he was designed for this specific task. Benjamin did not move because he was not a monster and he also did not see Noel as a threat. The square man stood only three feet tall. But that did not deter Bernard Zwirn's chants of encouragement. The king was convinced that Benjamin was a monster.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a monster,&#8221; Benjamin yelled back.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's something a monster would say!&#8221; Noel said as he leaped into the air and dove headfirst at Benjamin. Benjamin took one step to his left and Noel hit the carpet like a dice being tossed across the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;We do not welcome your kind here,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said.</p>

<p>&#8220;My kind?&#8221; Benjamin asked with confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dream makers do not interact with nightmares!&#8221; Noel screamed as he dove at Benjamin again, and again hit the ground like a square bowling ball bouncing across the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not a monster or a nightmare!&#8221; Benjamin responded. He was becoming more agitated that the king would not believe him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's exactly what a nightmare would say,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said in response. &#8220;Come on, Noel. Get him this time. Really concentrate hard. Give it your all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He keeps moving,&#8221; Noel said as he gasped for air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then wait until he stops moving,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said to Noel.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what if he moves again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, wait some more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hear you,&#8221; Benjamin said from the opposite side of the room with his hands on his hips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't listen to us, monster,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn replied.</p>

<p>Benjamin thought hard about how he could escape this situation. If he ran away, he did not know where he would run. He could not confess to being a monster because Noel would inevitably try to hurt him. He decided that the only way to remedy this predicament would be to convince these two men that he was not a monster.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do monsters do?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsters cause nightmares. They terrorize people. You should know,&#8221; Noel said. &#8220;You are a monster!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, you're terrorizing me,&#8221; Benjamin replied. &#8220;So, you two must be the monsters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn stood tall and shifted his head slightly as he looked upon the young child.</p>

<p>&#8220;We aren't the monsters,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said. &#8220;We aren't terrorizing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are most definitely terrorizing me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are terrorizing us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not! I was admiring these paintings and then that block monster tried to tackle me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That block's name is Noel Jaffin,&#8221; Noel responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;If monsters are creatures that terrorize other creatures, you are the monsters. I am not,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>Benjamin watched Bernard Zwirn's expression change from being cold and angry to back to warm and gentle. He began to breath more easily as he realized that he may have somehow convinced them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Benjamin,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said with his hands on his hips. &#8220;Where is this Pennsylvania you speak of?&#8221;</p>  





















<h1 id="chapter05">Chapter 5: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Are Automatons</h1>

<p>Benjamin followed Bernard Zwirn and Noel Jaffin through the ancient castle. He admired the green floor and yellow walls of a new hallway lined with windows on his left and plants on his right. He smelled flowers that reminded him of chocolates his parents would buy him in the spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, where is Ehtsetra?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't know exactly where they are located. And, we like it that way,&#8221; King Zwirn said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you like them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. We really like people from Ehtsetra. We like them a lot. But it's for our mutual protection that we don't know where the other is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Protection?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as they walked through another door to a hallway with white ceilings and blue walls with fish tanks on his left and stained glass windows on his right. The tropical fish swam throughout the enormous fish tank as if they were attempting to mirror the colorful glass display on their opposite side. &#8220;I need you to answer some questions from my advisors so that we can figure out how we can get you back to Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, who do you need to be protected from? What is Ehtsetra scared of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't worry, Benjamin. You won't ever have to worry about this. You don't want to. I'll get you home before you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin walked slowly because he was incredibly curious about what threatened King Bernard Zwirn. And, he didn't want to go back to Pennsylvania. Not now, at least. He just arrived and did not want to leave without knowing where Snark went. There was more to see here than there was at school, he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin?&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said when he realized that Benjamin was not moving forward.</p>

<p>As Benjamin looked at more of the paintings on the wall, he remembered one of the paintings that he saw earlier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did it say <i>we don't talk about it</i> above Aloysius Trenhaile's name?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that's an easy question,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn answered. &#8220;Because we do not talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who is Aloysius?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he live here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And people don't like him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or he did something really bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to find someone who can talk about it so that I know why we don't talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn stopped walking and closed his eyes in a way that Benjamin had seen his mother do when Benjamin was misbehaving. Noel Jaffin did not make eye contact with Bernard Zwirn and Benjamin sensed that the stocky man was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, we do not talk about it!&#8221; Bernard Zwirn snapped. &#8220;You cannot talk about something we do not talk about!&#8221;</p>

<p>They proceeded to walk forward and Benjamin did not ask any more questions. And although he was even more curious about Aloysius Trenhaile, he did not want to disobey King Bernard Zwirn. Living with curiosity was better than not being liked, Benjamin decided. And, he liked King Bernard Zwirn.</p>

<p>As yet another door opened to yet another colorful room, Benjamin was blinded by a bright light. The circular room looked like the inside of a round monument, the walls made of marble and the ceiling holding a mural with clouds that appeared to move. It was not a large room and Benjamin felt that Noel Jaffin was occupying an unfair amount of it because of his size. And that may have been his only thoughts about the room had there not been one more unusual and unique feature; he was surrounded by twelve automatons, machines that looked like people seated at desks as if they were in a meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;The elders of Castle Ehtahl would like to ask you a few questions, Benjamin,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he walked to a cabinet hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are these machines?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin! There are our elders! Don't insult them in front of them. Wait until you leave if you want to insult them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, they aren't human.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they're not. They are automatons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The elders of your castle are automatons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. The elders of my castle are lazy. They've been replaced by automatons because they got bored of asking the same questions over and over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn placed a quarter into a slot in the cabinet and then pulled a gigantic lever from the cabinet to the floor. As he did so, sparks burst from each of the automatons and they all made rickety noises as their tin and copper pieces shifted back and forth. They did not look graceful or smooth because their movements were quite jerky and their exteriors rusty in several spots. Some of the automatons did not have complete control over their movements causing their arms, lips, or legs to move in a peculiar ballet of metal and electricity.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; one of the automatons asked in a metallic, crisp voice.</p>

<p>Benjamin turned to face the automaton which had a pen in its crooked fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin Buckingham,&#8221; Benjamin responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your identification number?&#8221; another automaton asked from a different direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Override! Outsider questions,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said quickly. He gave Benjamin a nod of approval because Benjamin obviously did not have an identification number. The automatons shifted back and forth and jerked their limbs in various movements that together looked like they were synchronized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; another automaton asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Penn Syl Vannia?&#8221; another automaton asked with mispronunciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the United States?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK. We found Pennsylvania,&#8221; another automaton answered. &#8220;Is your address 18104 Huckleberry Road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Benjamin said with surprise. &#8220;How did you--.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you nine years old?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Benjamin replied with even more surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your relationship with Aloysius Trenhaile?&#8221; another automaton asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know who that is. Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't talk about it,&#8221; yet another automaton commented. &#8220;Who is the President of the United States?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barack Obama.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how did you get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bernard Zwirn took me here,&#8221; Benjamin responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pause!&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he raised the lever from the ground to the cabinet, powering down all of the automatons in the process. &#8220;We want to know how you came to Ehtahl? How did you wind up in the castle in first place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that's easy--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait for the automatons to return,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he powered the automatons to the jingle and jangle and clanking of metal parts.</p>

<p>Benjamin relayed the story of how he got to where he was today. He mentioned running through Prague in his dream, waking up to find a dinosaur under his bed, following the dinosaur into an unknown land, seeing a gladiator battle, and everything that led to that moment. If machines could look as surprised as Bernard Zwirn and Noel Jaffin did, these automatons were as shocked by this outcome as anyone else. Benjamin took a deep breath after he finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you really here?&#8221; an automaton asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to see where the dinosaur was going,&#8221; Benjamin said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinosaur?&#8221; Bernard Zwirn asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The tyrannosaurus rex from my dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn groaned through his teeth and rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Rodney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney! He kept saying that name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Rodney Cohen,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said while shaking his head. &#8220;That guy gets us in so much trouble we're not going to be able to do what we do much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll tell you all about it as we leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Benjamin, we need to get you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I don't want to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not really your choice,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said. &#8220;Elders, when does the next train leave to get Benjamin back to Pennsylvania?&#8221;</p>

<p>The automatons moved back and forth in a more rigid, uncontrolled fashion. They jerked from side to side and steam started pouring from their heads, sending a screeching sound into the air. Joints started to disconnect and pieces of robots starts to fall all over the ground.</p>

<p>One automaton leaned forward and moved its jaw slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten minutes. The following train is in several months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten minutes!&#8221; Bernard Zwirn exclaimed. &#8220;Benjamin, we have to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where am I? What's threatening Castle Ehtahl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to run!&#8221;</p>  




















<h1 id="chapter06">Chapter 6: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Magical Escape Train</h1>

<p>Benjamin and Bernard Zwirn sprinted down one hallway, then another, and then another until Benjamin lost a sense of which direction he was going. Everything felt disorienting and confusing. The more he saw of this castle, the less he understood it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We've got nine minutes to get you to the train station,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said in between breaths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can't I take the next train?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trains are too infrequent and I've got a busy schedule. If you don't get on that train, I don't know what we're going to do with you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could keep to myself. I'll just look around and see where all the dinosaurs live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, you won't be able to live here because this place is much different than where you're from. This is, how should I say, a little bit like a manufacturing city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A manufacturing city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we make something here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like bikes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind of like bikes,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he opened a door to the outside world. &#8220;It's a little bit more complicated than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you make?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he glanced at his watch. &#8220;We're going to be late. We've got seven minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin thought about stopping, so that Bernard Zwirn had no choice but to let him live in Castle Ehtahl for a while. He knew Bernard Zwirn would not be able to pull him to the train station. He was a large man but he looked like he had the strength of someone a quarter the size.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll sprint to the train,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;Because I'm a lot faster than you but in exchange, you have to tell me what you make here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deal!&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said quickly, his brow covered in sweat and his chest heaving back and forth like rough waves in the ocean. &#8220;We make dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we make dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean you make dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn removed a necklace and held it to Benjamin. On the end, there was a small brass key that looked like it was much older than the king who wore it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to use this key to get into the train station. You go straight towards that gigantic tower, then make a left and run along the river to a series of blue, yellow, and green buildings. The yellow building is the entrance to the train station and you'll need this key to get inside. This key is the only way you can get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I don't understand what you mean--&#8221; Benjamin began.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have five minutes to run straight for that gigantic tower, then make a left and run along--&#8221; Bernard Zwirn began repeating the directions again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sorry,&#8221; Benjamin replied. &#8220;What do you mean you make dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We make dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make dreams come true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, this isn't Hollywood, Benjamin. We make real dreams. When you go to sleep at night and you have a dream, those dreams are manufactured here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, here. And if you stay here, your presence will throw off the balance of peace and we're not going to be able to produce dreams for very much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't understand. Peace? Who is threatening to hurt you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't expect you to,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he grabbed Benjamin by the shoulders. &#8220;You have to leave because if you don't, this castle and the dreams it creates might be destroyed by nightmares. You have to run. The less you know, the better. If you want to have dreams of dinosaurs again, you need to sprint as fast as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin wanted to dream of dinosaurs again and immediately turned from Bernard Zwirn and ran as fast as he could. Run for the gigantic tower, Benjamin thought to himself. It was impossible to miss the tower and Benjamin had already seen it from the windows of the castle. As he got closer and closer to it, he noticed it had far more moving parts than he had thought. Each individual piece seemed to move independent of all of the other parts, as if it was the most complex watch ever created. He wanted to inspect the tower further but he also wanted to have more dreams so he ran through crowds to the bank of the river. As he turned left towards the yellow building, he slipped on the ground and the brass key fell from his grasp. Benjamin got to his knees and crawled five feet to it. He reached for the brass key and extended his fingers. But then, a heavy leather boot with rusty metal lining stepped on it. Benjamin tried to push the boot away but it would not budge. He looked up and  saw a vile, awful face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; the evil man said with a sly tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're standing on my key,&#8221; Benjamin exclaimed. &#8220;I have to get to the train station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you have to go so soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you? Why are you stopping me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm dreadfully sorry. Where were my manners?&#8221; he said as he ground his boot further and further into the ground. &#8220;My name is Richard Fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know my name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone here knows your name, Benjamin. You're quite the talk of the castle. Even Selma knows your name,&#8221; Richard Fox said with a smirk. &#8220;We've never had someone from outside the castle come to visit us. It's quite, how should I say, special.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Selma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just some girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just leaving so if you would give me that key, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? Wouldn't you like to stay and learn more about making dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;King Bernard Zwirn said I have to or else I'll throw off the balance of dreams and nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richard Fox shifted more of his weight onto the brass key.</p>

<p>&#8220;He's always saying that, you know?&#8221; Richard Fox said with a curious grin. He wore a heavy leather trench coat and a dark hat that seemed too hot for such a warm day. Benjamin tried to push his boot again but Richard Fox resisted further.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to let me go!&#8221; Benjamin yelled at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you want to stay?&#8221; Richard Fox asked again with an uncomfortably villainous tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, stay!&#8221; Richard Fox yelled. &#8220;I give you my permission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, King Bernard Zwirn said--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, King Bernard Zwirn is always saying these things. He wants the castle all to himself and he doesn't want anyone to interfere. I bet he didn't show you any of the castle, did he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, he didn't. But, he seemed friendly enough and he told me that I needed to get home quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he did. He wanted to get you out of the way so that he can make sure he can continue to manufacture dreams here. He doesn't want you to learn how they're made because that'll mean you could make your own dreams elsewhere. I think you should stay, Benjamin,&#8221; Richard Fox said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to leave!&#8221; Benjamin yelled. He realized he wanted to leave Richard Fox more than Castle Ehtahl, but both things felt the same at that moment. &#8220;I'm going home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin pushed one more time on Richard Fox's foot and the boot jerked away. The brass key looked delicate despite the heavy boot upon it. Benjamin grabbed the key and jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>Yellow house, Benjamin thought to himself. He had to get to the yellow house.</p>

<p>He ran past the blue building and then past the green building. At the yellow house, there was a keyhole in the middle of a large door that appeared to be the size of the brass key that Benjamin held. Benjamin jammed the key inside and was thrilled when he noticed it fit perfectly. He used the full weight of his tiny body to move the door open. Once there was enough room for him to squeeze inside, he found himself in the most beautiful, spacious, and grand train station he had ever seen. There were people drinking coffee from balcony seats looking down on train conductors walking along the platform amid women selling flowers and men shining shoes. There was room for dozens of trains to pull into the station and the roof was high enough that it felt like it was an enclosed stadium. The outside of the yellow building did not foretell at all what Benjamin saw in the inside. He felt as if he had wandered into a time when trains were the most important technology of an era. And among these trains, Benjamin saw one last train at gate number sixteen.</p>

<p>Benjamin felt it was inappropriate to be sprinting as quickly as he was through such a tranquil, beautiful setting but he also felt there was no other option to reaching the train in time. He was ten gates away when he heard the conductor start the steam engine, nine gates away when he heard the wheels begin to churn, eight gates away when the cars started to tug at each other, seven gates away when he heard the train whistle, six gates away when the wheels made their first rotation, five gates away when the locomotive began leaving the station, four gates away when the first passenger car left the station, three gates away when half the train had left the station, two gates away when the locomotive whistled again, and one gate away when he watched it leave the station altogether.</p>

<p>He missed the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Benjamin heard a man scream from the entrance of the train station. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; yelled Bernard Zwirn. &#8220;You were supposed to be on that train!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried,&#8221; Benjamin said between large breaths. &#8220;I ran as fast as I could but it left without me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have run faster,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said with an increasing amount of anxiety. &#8220;This isn't good, Benjamin. This isn't good at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll get on the next train,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;If there's one this afternoon, I'll take that one. If there's one this evening, I'll take it. Or even if I have to wait until tomorrow, I'll take that one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, the next train is in a month!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin's face turned white as he imagined what his mother was going to say to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;A month?&#8221; Benjamin asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a month! You have to wait a month!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't wait a month!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know! You can't wait a month! That's why you need to be on that train,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn yelled to no one in particular.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why aren't there more trains?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People don't leave Castle Ehtahl,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he sat on a bench next to a dozen dogs barking at a bird sitting on a standing clock. &#8220;We don't get visitors and we don't leave. We have no reason to have trains coming and going so frequently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried really hard to get to the train station on time,&#8221; Benjamin started to say, becoming a little scared and sad about the situation that he now found himself in. &#8220;I didn't try to miss the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It happens,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said. &#8220;It's fine. There's nothing we can do about it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to make it but then Russell Fox stepped on the brass ring and I couldn't get it quick enough and then he delayed me by at least two minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn stood from the bench and looked even more concerned than he had just been. The dogs next to him ran away and the bird on the clock took flight. The entire station went quiet and still.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Bernard Zwirn asked very slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russell Fox stepped on the brass key,&#8221; Benjamin responded very quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know Russell Fox? He prevented you from getting to the train station in time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stood on the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say anything else to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin thought hard about this question and was worried that he was taking too long to respond. Everything Richard Fox had told him had been about Bernard Zwirn, and Benjamin was not sure if any of it was true. He did not know where he was and did not want to put himself in a situation where he felt in danger. He needed to quickly assess who could be his friends and protectors until he could get on the next train.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said you wanted me to leave,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's correct. I do want you to leave, for your own protection,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn responded. &#8220;Did he say anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer to these complicated questions did not come quick enough for Benjamin. He knew that Bernard Zwirn knew that Benjamin was stalling.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said you did not want anyone else to make dreams,&#8221; Benjamin said each word while trying to observe Bernard Zwirn's response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russell Fox!&#8221; Bernard Zwirn yelled into the air. &#8220;Benjamin, for the next month, you are not to talk to that man. You have to understand me. This is for your own protection. Russell Fox is not a good person these days. He was good, at one time, but those days are gone. This is a difficult time for Castle Ehtahl and I don't want you to get wrapped in the middle of it. I need you to obey my orders and I'll get you safely out of this castle in a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin swallowed hard and with his instincts felt that he had to trust Bernard Zwirn more than he trusted Russell Fox. Bernard Zwirn wanted Benjamin to leave and there was no harm in leaving. But, Russell Fox wanted Benjamin to stay and Benjamin did not know if there was harm in staying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Also, King Zwirn,&#8221; Benjamin asked quietly. &#8220;Who is Selma?&#8221;</p>   





















<h1 id="chapter07">Chapter 7: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Girl Named Selma</h1>

<p>Benjamin tossed and turned in his bed, hoping that a gigantic wave would send him flailing into a gigantic mast, that dinosaurs were on an adventure with him to stop Professor Undutois, and that he could be among his friends. But as he continued to roll about, he could not dream. He thought, perhaps, it was because he was in a different environment. This was not his bedroom, after all. It was a large room filled with ten other students who all lived in the same dormitory and attended the same classes. Benjamin sat on the edge of his bed and remarked how everyone else was able to sleep peacefully. They must be having amazing dreams of far off places and incredible experiences and gladiator battles and being heros. All he got from his first night sleeping in this foreign place was exhaustion.</p>

<p>The lights flickered on and the door at the end of the room opened, revealing a tall, skinny woman who looked much more refreshed than Benjamin felt. It was his teacher, Miss Estelle Lindenmeyer. She had light red hair and blue eyes slightly hidden by yellow glasses. Her hair lay on her shoulders and she always wore light colored clothing like whites and off-whites and off-off-whites. And as she spoke, Benjamin understood why Bernard Zwirn told him earlier that she was the nicest person in Castle Ehtahl.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, time to wake up,&#8221; Estelle Lindenmeyer said to all of the boys in the room. She then left, closed the door halfway, and walked to the other end of the hallway. Benjamin could hear the soft pattering of her shoes hitting the wooden floor as she headed for the girls' room.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, time to wake up,&#8221; he heard Estelle Lindenmeyer say to another group of students.</p>

<p>Benjamin was already awake because he barely slept. It was uncomfortable being in a new place with new people and he did not like that he did not have the privacy of his own bedroom. When he thought about the adventures that he was about to embark upon, he did not imagine that in some cases, the circumstances would be less awesome than his circumstances at home. He had his own bedroom at home, after all.</p>

<p>The boys stood, yawned, rubbed their eyes, and did the various other body movements that these creatures do in the first minutes of the beginning of a new day. Everyone looked similar to his classmates from home. People must not be that different, Benjamin thought to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Move,&#8221; the boy on the bed next to Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, I'm Benjamin,&#8221; Benjamin replied, trying to make his first friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're on my shirt. Move,&#8221; the boy said as Benjamin realized that he was standing on a shirt that the boy wanted to wear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sorry,&#8221; Benjamin said as he moved his foot. He had obviously made it dirty and was not thrilled about having unsuccessfully made a new friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; the boy asked as he rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name's Benjamin. What's your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ralph,&#8221; the boy answered as he stood and walked to the exit. &#8220;But, I've never seen you before. You're the Benjamin everyone's talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so. I'm new. I was supposed to leave on a train yesterday but I missed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you're in our class now?&#8221; Ralph asked with a confused face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weird. So, where are you really from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys! Let's go,&#8221; Estelle Lindenmeyer said as she entered the door again. Benjamin was glad that she interrupted their brief, not very cordial conversation because he was not sure how to answer the question as to where he was from without causing alarm.</p>

<p>Each of the boys walked passed Estelle Lindenmeyer and as they did so, the teacher checked off their name with a pencil on a paper attached to a clipboard. The boys walked through and Estelle Lindenmeyer acknowledged their presence. But then, she saw that Benjamin was still in the room and that he was having a little trouble tying his shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not so bad, once you do it a thousand times,&#8221; Estelle Lindenmeyer said as she walked towards him. &#8220;You must be Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, I'm Benjamin,&#8221; Benjamin said awkwardly. He was still trying his best to make a good first impression with everyone.</p>

<p>&#8220;King Bernard Zwirn told me all about you. My name is Miss Lindenmeyer and I'll be your teacher for the next month I presume,&#8221; she said so softly and warmly that Benjamin immediately knew that if no one else, he could trust her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't mean to miss the train,&#8221; Benjamin offered as he did not want to be seen as irresponsible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it's fine,&#8221; she said as she escorted Benjamin through the exit. &#8220;Our train schedule is goofy anyways. So, King Bernard Zwirn tells me that you're in the fifth grade. Is that correct?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I'm in fifth grade. My teacher is Mr. Marchetta but he isn't very good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no?&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said with more curiosity than Benjamin expected. &#8220;What don't you like about the way he teaches?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn't really pay attention to what the kids do in the classroom. I don't think he can see, to be honest. He looks like he's staring far off into the distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, every teacher has a different teaching style,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she positioned Benjamin at the end of a line. There were  about twenty students his age ahead of him. &#8220;I think you're going to find that my teaching style is a little different than other teachers you may have had. You'll be fine and if you have any questions or if you get nervous about anything, let me know and I'll help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin felt more relieved that his teacher was so much nicer than Mr. Marchetta. Miss Lindenmeyer already knew Benjamin's name and made him feel so calm that he began to think he might actually enjoy going to school here.</p>

<p>The students walked forward in a single line and Benjamin saw that they were all dressed in the same uniform. The boys had similar haircuts and the girls wore their hair in a similar style. The line itself alternated boy and girl, which Benjamin found amusing because his school was not as organized as this school.</p>

<p>As he walked forward, the girl in front of him turned and gave Benjamin a confused face. He expected to receive these types of expressions on the first day. He received peculiar looks all the time at home. These children already knew each other and Benjamin would be the new kid. It was fine, he thought, because he was used to feeling like the odd person left out.</p>

<p>They continued walking forward and the same girl spun around again, this time giving Benjamin a confused expression that bordered on anger. Benjamin did not know how to respond so he smiled cautiously. It was not his best smile. It may not have been his worst, though. He was not sure but he was trying to smile somewhere in between his best and his worst smile. Never before in his life had he concentrated on such things. But realizing that he had a fresh start, he was determined to be liked by these children.</p>

<p>The girl spun around once more and stared at Benjamin and shook her head from side to side. Benjamin smiled again, this time showing more teeth than he wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; Benjamin said quietly so as not to cause the entire line of students to turn around. &#8220;Are you by chance Selma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet! Who are you?&#8221; the girl asked precisely. Her diction was perfect but her manners were abrupt. Benjamin worried that he was interacting with a classroom bully like Howard Horne.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name's Benjamin. I'm new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you're new. If you weren't new, I wouldn't have asked you who you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that's right. Are you Selma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll ask the questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK. Do you have any more questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's another question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK. I'm not sure what I should be saying right now. Maybe you should say something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't say things like that so you must not be from here. Where are you from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm from Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the word Pennsylvania left his mouth, all of the students stopped walking. There was a collective, loud gasp of surprise followed by books and backpacks falling to the ground. Several students hid behind other students while the larger of the bunch tried to move the line further and further away from Benjamin. He could feel their nervous, tense reaction as he watched them stare with wide eyes and lowered jaws.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, children,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she walked to the back of the line. &#8220;I guess now is as good a time as any to introduce our new student. This is Benjamin Buckingham from Pennsylvania. That's right. He's not from here. He's going to be with us for the next month as a foreign exchange student. Everyone, please be nice and give a warm hello to Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Benjamin,&#8221; the class said in unison and in a worried, confused voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;He's from Pennsylvania,&#8221; Ralph whispered to Miss Lindenmeyer loud enough that Benjamin could hear this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, right, so Benjamin isn't from Castle Ehtahl. Benjamin's from Pennsylvania,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said.</p>

<p>The class reacted exactly as they had when they heard Benjamin say the word. There was gasps, books dropping, children cowering, and lots of fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, that's OK. We're going to treat him like he's from Castle Ehtahl. He'll get along fine .&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, we can't. He can't know what we do here,&#8221; the girl in front of Benjamin said with total concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, it'll be OK. He'll learn enough to make dreaming more interesting but he won't learn too much that he won't enjoy dreaming anymore. A month will be too short a time for anything crazy to happen. Now, let's keep going to the classroom,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she gently guided each student back into a single line.</p>

<p>Benjamin felt some nervous looks and glances from the other students. He did not think it was going to be easy to become friends with everyone now. No one seemed to like Pennsylvania, he thought, and he didn't quite understand why. But at least, he had finally met Selma. She was interesting, he thought. He didn't know why she was so defensive.</p>

<p>When Benjamin entered the classroom, he knew that he had entered a school in which he had never been before. There was color everywhere. Paper trees lined the back wall with branches that spread to the ceiling to reveal a blue sky with clouds hanging over desks. Flowers and animals lined the other sides, drawn to a detail that Benjamin thought looked so realistic. Each chair was a different color and each desk had multiple color combinations. It was like he had walked upon a painter's color pallet. And at the front of the class was King Bernard Zwirn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, everyone!&#8221; King Zwirn said in a warm tone. &#8220;Is everyone ready to learn today?&#8221;</p>

<p>The class moaned in unison and King Zwirn chuckled in response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you have fun and I also hope everyone's had a chance to meet Benjamin,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;You're all very lucky to meet someone who lives outside Castle Ehtahl. He's a great kid and I hope you all get to spend a lot of time with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>King Zwirn waved farewell and left the room. Benjamin sat in the back of the classroom, behind Selma Applebaum who he could now identify. He hoped she wasn't the class bully but for the moment, he wasn't sure. She didn't seem to like him very much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Today, we're going to continue our lesson on creating dreams for grumpy old men!&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer told the class as she drew two old men on the chalkboard. There were some giggles throughout the classroom. &#8220;If you remember our lesson last week, who wants to tell me the three important rules that you have to keep in mind when you create a dream for a grumpy old man? Just imagine a grumpy King Bernard Zwirn going to sleep at night,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said to the laughter of the class. It was almost impossible to imagine a grumpy King Zwirn.</p>

<p>Every student stretched their hand to the sky but Benjamin noticed that Selma was stretching her hand much higher than all of the other students. She was almost standing as she stretched her body further and further. He had never been in a classroom where there had been such eagerness to answer a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steven, why don't you give me the rules,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said to a larger boy who was sitting next to Ralph.</p>

<p>Steven stood from his chair and counted the rules on his finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;First, the dream can't be too crazy because the grumpy old man could have a heart attack and that's not good,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she wrote<i> crazy dream equals heart attack</i> on the board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Second, the dream can't be too happy because the grumpy old man will become even more grumpy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she wrote <i>too happy equals more grumpy</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;And third, the dream can't happen in too many different places or the grumpy old man will get lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first two were correct,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;But, I think you're confusing the third one with one of the rules for creating a dream for people who get turned around easily. Do you know the third rule for grumpy old man dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>Steven shrugged his shoulders. And as soon as his shoulders started to rotate around, Selma's hand shot back into the air again. She wanted to answer the question more than any other student in the room and Benjamin realized that Miss Lindenmeyer was deliberately not calling on her. But since no one else had a hand in the error, there was no one else to answer the question but Selma.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, Selma,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said in a way that sounded like she said these words several times every day. &#8220;What's the answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't include anything in the dream that made the grumpy old man grumpy in the first place,&#8221; Selma said as fast as she raised her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she wrote <i>grumpy memories equals grumpier old man</i>.</p>

<p>Benjamin was impressed that Selma knew the answer but he did not understand what it meant. Who were these grumpy men, he wondered, and why were these kids talking about the rules for dreams. In his classroom at home, they only talked about their own dreams. It was confusing but he did not want to ask basic questions in front of everyone because he knew he was the only one who didn't know the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, are you able to follow along?&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer asked as if she was reading his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind of,&#8221; Benjamin said quietly. &#8220;But, how do you make dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>The class laughed and Benjamin immediately regretted asking the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's a perfectly fine question, Benjamin. The class is laughing because they never thought to ask such a question. They've been watching dreams be made their entire lives. Basically, we make dreams inside studios throughout the castle. Each person who has a dream, like the grumpy old man, has different rules assigned to them. So, that's why it's important that we learn them here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Lindenmeyer turned to the chalkboard and began to clear space to write. Benjamin wasn't completely sure what she meant because it felt so foreign to him. People didn't make dreams. Dreams were something that happened in his head while he was asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you understand that?&#8221; Selma asked Benjamin in a way that suggested she wanted to give Benjamin more explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Benjamin said with a confused tone. &#8220;But, not really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Selma said. &#8220;Because I study the hardest in this classroom and I work harder than everyone else and I'm not about to let someone from Pennsylvania come in and ruin it all for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin was taken aback by her attitude and did not quite know how to respond. He did not want to agitate her further.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not here to ruin anything. I missed my train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet you did,&#8221; Selma said as she spun around and raised her hand to answer Miss Lindenmeyer's next question.</p>

<p>As Selma walked to the front of the classroom to draw a layout for a dream in which a grandmother parachutes over a length of the Amazon jungle, Benjamin thought about switching seats to be closer to Ralph and Steven. There was an empty seat near them and Benjamin had decided that it was in his best interest to be friends with them rather than Selma.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then you have to make sure a fire extinguisher is available for each of the actors because there's a chance that the grandmother could catch on fire,&#8221; Selma concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as the rest of the class groaned slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma knows all about fires because her dad broke the dream machine,&#8221; Steven said as he gave Ralph a high-five.</p>

<p>Selma stared at Steven and Ralph as she slowly made her way back to her seat. Benjamin found it peculiar that in this classroom, Selma didn't fight back against the two boys. She just went back to her seat and sat quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not nice, Steven,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;And remember, your mother has made her fair share of fires as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest of the class laughed in a way that Benjamin didn't quite understand. He was also a little distracted because as bright as the room was, it was starting to get darker and darker. Over the course of a few minutes, the room became so dark that Miss Lindenmeyer had to turn on a light switch near the door. But, it was still early in the afternoon. The sun was still out, Benjamin observed through the window. </p>

<p>His curiosity overwhelmed him and he raised his hand to find an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the dream machine?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dream machine is the large tower in the center of the castle that powers all of the dreams. Without it, there are no dreams. And only recently, it broke for reasons we don't quite understand. Not everyone wants to dream, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; Benjamin said even though he did not quite understand. &#8220;And, why did it suddenly get dark?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Miss Lindenmeyer could answer, there was a loud scream from outside the school. It was loud enough to cause Benjamin to worry that someone was in trouble. But inside the classroom, no one said anything and no one looked out the window. Everyone continued to stay seated as they had before.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't talk about it,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said with her lips clenched together.</p>



















<h1 id="chapter8">Chapter 8: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Production Studio </h1>

<p>The next day, King Bernard Zwirn wanted to take Benjamin on a short tour of the castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You've already seen a lot of the castle,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said as they walked passed the enormous dream machine. &#8220;But, I'd like to show you a little more. What's it like living in Pennsylvania, Benjamin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's fine,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;I've never lived anywhere else so I suppose it's the best place I've ever lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven't lived anywhere else, either. So, I suppose this is the best place I've ever lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been the king?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For quite a few years, Benjamin. I'm rather old. I feel young, but I'm old. I've been king for quite some time. And as the years go by, I wonder how long I'll continue to be king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? You don't want to be king?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I'd love to be king forever, if I could. But, it's not up to me. There are some people, one of which you met the other day, who do not want me to be king. They want to be king. And one day, that might just happen. But so long as I'm alive, that won't be the case. I care too much about dreams, Benjamin. I think everyone should be able to dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can't everyone dream?&#8221;</p>

<p>King Bernard Zwirn turned to Benjamin with a smile. Benjamin realized that the question was a little naive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may find this hard to believe, but not everyone wants to dream. There are some people out there that want nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They want nightmares instead of dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they want nightmares. It wasn't always this way. In the beginning of all of this, there was only one castle and there were only dreams. But now, there are many castles and not all of them make dreams. Some of them make nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are these castles? The ones that make nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They're outside the castle walls. And don't worry, Benjamin. We have a security fleet that works day and night to make sure that nightmares do not entire this castle. That, I can assure you. You won't have to worry about nightmares invading our dreams. I only wish we could make dreams forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Lindenmeyer told me that the dream machine is broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, yes. I'm not exactly sure who did it but I have my suspicions. There are only a few more weeks left of dreams before we can no longer make them. I think there's a part missing but I have no idea which one. Have you looked at this thing?&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said as they rested on a bench near the gigantic tower. &#8220;I can't begin to tell you how many pieces are in there. My guess would be millions. But who knows? And if there's a piece missing, how can I know where it was supposed to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you need to make the dream machine work again. I want to continue dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of dinosaurs, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; Benjamin said enthusiastically. &#8220;Do you know about your dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that your dreams are some of the most elaborate dreams that we produce. And, I know that you're a fan of Snark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snark! That's who I followed to get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a feeling. Rodney, I mean Snark, has a way of getting himself into trouble sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my last dream, King Zwirn. In my last dream, something horrible was chasing after me. I had never dreamed of it before. It wasn't in any of my previous dreams&#8221;</p>

<p>King Zwirn paused and glanced at the ground. He put his hand on Benjamin's back and guided him away from the dream machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. And, I'm sorry you had to see that. We do our best to keep nightmares out of the dreams but it's getting harder and harder. Do you want to see where dreams are made?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Definitely!&#8221; Benjamin said. He wanted to see where all the dinosaurs lived and where all of the spaceshuttle launches happend.</p>

<p>&#8220;You'll understand a little more in a bit but I need you to wear this vest. It's small but it's going to let everyone know that you're with me. If anyone asks who you are or what you're doing, you just tell them that you're my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin accepted the vest from King Bernard Zwirn and stared at it for a moment. No one had ever said something like that to him before. He thought he had friends in the past but was always unsure. King Bernard Zwirn made it clear that he wanted to be Benjamin's friend. And with that, Benjamin felt a wave of happiness overwhelm his body.</p>

<p>Benjamin and King Zwirn left for an ancient red building immediately next door to the dream machine. As they passed people, King Bernard Zwirn said hello to each one and greeted them by their names. Benjamin couldn't believe this man knew so many different names. He seemed like he could have a conversation with anyone. And, everyone seemed to like him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is production building two thousand seven hundred and eighty eight,&#8221; King Zwirn said as they walked down a brightly lit hallway with hundreds of white doors on both the left and right. The hallway extended so far that Benjamin could not see the door on the other side. It was also so bright that he had to cup his hands around his eyes to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two thousand seven hundred and eighty eight?&#8221; Benjamin asked. &#8220;How many production buildings are there?&#8221;</p>

<p>King Bernard Zwirn stopped and looked to the ceiling as if he was counting them in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not sure,&#8221; he said with a chuckle. &#8220;They come and go but somewhere around six billion I think. How many people live in Pennsylvania?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, it's probably a number I should know but I don't. Let's just say there's a lot. There's a lot of people that live in Pennsylvania, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, there are a lot of production studios.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is behind each of these doors?&#8221; Benjamin asked as he reached for a handle.</p>

<p>King Bernard Zwirn pulled Benjamin back softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;I need to open the doors for you. Once I open the doors, you'll be able to see the dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>They continued walking down the hallway and by Benjamin's count, King Bernard Zwirn stopped in front of the twenty-ninth door on the right hand side. He placed his hand on the doorknob and then looked Benjamin with a large smile. It was calming to Benjamin whose heart was racing with anticipation of what was behind these mysterious door.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is where a dream is created,&#8221; he said as he opened the door and pushed Benjamin inside. King Bernard Zwirn held his fingers to his lips and gestured to Benjamin to remain silent. He immediately understood why he had to wear the orange vest because there were many other people wearing orange vests as well.</p>

<p>Benjamin watched a large speedboat cruising as fast as it could through a river that raged through a metropolis. Buildings towered everywhere. A person sat in the driver's seat with a large smile, the wind throwing his hair back, and the sun bouncing light off his face. There were cameras everywhere capturing every angle and cranes holding lights and speakers above the stage. The speed boat roared as it switched gears and rocked back and forth as waves crashed into it. It went underneath bridges and passed sailboats and turned suddenly and headed the other direction. The metropolis looked like a metal forest that the speed boat moved through as quickly as it could. People in orange vests were moving the set as the man in the speed boat stood and then screamed with joy. Benjamin felt the joy the man must have been experiencing as everything here looked like so much fun. He wanted to ride a speed boat through a city.</p>

<p>In the hallway, Benjamin couldn't contain his excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was amazing! That looked so cool!&#8221; Benjamin shouted as King Bernard Zwirn laughed. &#8220;But, how is that someone's dream? Those were actors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we went through that door, we stepped inside someone'e head, for a short moment. And someone out there far, far away from here is dreaming right now and he is dreaming of driving a speedboat through a city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I never saw cameras or lights or speakers or people wearing orange vests in my dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;YYou don't see the cameras or lights or speakers or people wearing orange vests because no one dreams in orange. You don't see anything in orange in your dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>King Bernard Zwirn grinned a little and ushered Benjamin down the hallway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I'm actually not sure, but so far, it's been the case. To be honest, I think most people are so focused on their dreams that they don't notice any of the things happening around the dream. No one notices the lights and cameras and scene changes. We've gotten very good at producing them over the years. I'd like to say that our dreams are getting better and better.&#8221;

<p>They walked inside another dream and saw a ski slope higher than any building Benjamin had ever seen. At the very top stood a skier whose smile stretched wider than her face. All around her, people in orange suits carried lighting instruments and speakers as the woman bounced back and forth. Before she leaped down the slope, Benjamin thought that she saw him, that they had exchanged glances for one moment. But before he could think any further, she moved down that hill as fast as that speed boat had moved through that river. Snow splattered and sprayed in all directions as she raced between trees, jumped over large rocks, and did flips in the air over bored brown bears. Benjamin could hear the calmness of the wind as well as the sound of her skis carving into the snow.</p>

<p>King Bernad Zwirn took Benjamin into another production studio.</p>

<p>Here, Benjamin awed at a propeller airplane dodging cloud after cloud that people in orange vests had sent into the air. The old grandmother inside the plane laughed as she maneuvered it from side to side and then into a full loop. Benjamin noticed his smile was widening like the smiles of the people who were experiencing these dreams. In each of these production studios, adventures were being created in the form of a dream very much like his own dreams. Everything before him was created by machines and people. The clouds, the blue sky, the trees on the ground, the birds flying past the airplane, and the sun in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one is next?&#8221; Benjamin asked with excitement as he jumped from side to side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to direct some more dreams so we need to go to the control center,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a control center?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dreaming is actually quite organized.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked from ancient building to ancient building. And as Benjamin passed each door, he listened to the sounds of excitement and happiness being made in a dream studio on the other side. He didn't know how it was all possible but he didn't care. He knew that all of the other kids from home would be jealous of what Benjamin was experiencing.</p>

<p>Benjamin and King Bernard Zwirn ascended dozens of staircases up a tall, brick tower. The king was in very good shape, Benjamin thought, because the stairs were exhausting. As they climbed higher, Benjamin looked out small windows to see more of the castle. He could see the train station and the river and the dream machine. He could even see the school and dormitory. Yet when Benjamin saw that large walls that guarded the castle, he realized that he was very far away from home. And under normal circumstances, this would have bothered him tremendously. But, he knew King Bernard Zwirn would be able to get him home eventually. For t

<p>King Bernard Zwirn stepped into a circular room at the top of this tower. Inside, there were many people chatting and yelling orders back and forth. Across all of the walls, there were television screens. And underneath these television screens were windows that revealed an amazing view of the castle below. From here, Benjamin could see into all of the dream studios below. There were more than he could ever have imagined.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the control tower,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said as he opened his arms like he did the first day Benjamin met him. &#8220;It's almost ten o'clock in Los Angeles so it's just about time for some dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin took a sit in an empty chair and marvelled over all of the people moving about. It looked like they were preparing for a spaceshuttle launch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready everyone?&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said to a room full of happy men and women who cheered their king on. &#8220;We're going live in five, four, three, two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin would normally have been at home. He would have been the recipient of one of these dreams. But instead, he was observing them. He realized among all the dreaming that King Bernard Zwirn had an ability to make everyone feel good about themselves. It was as if making dreams come true and King Bernard Zwirn were inseparable.</p>

<p>&#8220;One,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said. And at that moment, everyone was silent.</p>



























<h1 id="chapter9">Chapter 9: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is An Attack</h1>

<p>Benjamin never thought about how many people dreamed at the same time. He had always thought about his own dreams that he just hadn't realized how many others happened at the same time. It was impossible to ignore from the control tower. He could see into all of the dreams on the screens and in the production studios below.</p>

<p>He also realized that some people have simpler dreams than others. There was a screen in front of him with a man standing on a bridge looking down upon waterlilies. There were no explosions or high speed chases or dangerous situations. It was just waterlilies and a bridge. And to the right of this screen, there was a woman looking at an owl, watermelon, pineapple, and coconut on a yellow table. Further along, there was a young child looking at a man on all fours carrying a gigantic basket of flowers on his back, that was strapped to him with a yellow cloth and supported by a larger woman. Benjamin expected dreams to be adventurous. He did not realize that dreams don't necessarily have to be what he thought were adventurous. There were what Benjamin knew as adventurous dreams, however.</p>

<p>There were car chases.</p>

<p>And base jumping.</p>

<p>And throwing fire.</p>

<p>And people chasing animals.</p>

<p>And animals chasing people.</p>

<p>And flying. Lots of flying</p>

<p>And dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Snark! Benjamin thought as he saw friend in screen eighteen thousand, one hundred and four. It was him, it was definitely Snark.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's him!&#8221; Benjamin yelled to King Bernard Zwirn.</p>

<p>King Bernard Zwirn was standing in the middle of all of the people who worked for him. He was offering suggestions for making the dreams better by changing certain screens or adjusting lighting or increasing the volume of certain sounds or encouraging more creativity. He pointed every which direction and simultaneously seemed to be talking to more people than Benjamin had ever known in his entire life. He spoke commands with such confidence and poise that he did not seem to sweat at all. Benjamin knew that if he was in charge, his heart would race and his mind would be overwhelmed with thoughts. For King Bernard Zwirn, however, he acted like he had been doing this his entire life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn asked.</p>

<p>Benjamin was impressed that King Bernard Zwirn answered him enough that he was so busy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Snark! That's him!&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;That's the dinosaur from my dream, the one who took me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Expand one eight one zero four, please,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said warmly.</p>

<p>The small screen where Benjamin expanded to fill nearly a quarter of the entire room. It was definitely him, Benjamin thought. He looked at King Bernard Zwirn who had a look of confusion on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is Rodney Cohen working?&#8221; King Bernard asked gently to some people in the room.</p>

<p>Benjamin did not know who he was speaking to but he could hear the brief sounds of someone responding back to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him that he needed to take a break. He was overworked. Benjamin wouldn't be here if he just got more rest. Rodney works too hard,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said gently to anyone who would listen.</p>

<p>Rodney Cohen must play Snark in my dreams, Benjamin thought to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Rodney is a perso who acts as a dinosaur in dreams?&#8221; Benjamin asked softly and curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He's not always a dinosaur but he does play that role quite often.&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said. &#8220;But do realize that this doesn't change your dream. Your dreams are with dinosaurs. They're merely acted by people and Rodney is one of them. He's a workaholic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I meet him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that's the thing, Benjamin. You'd meet Rodney Cohen here but you'd meet Snark in your dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'd still like to meet Rodney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, I'll set up a meeting for the two of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>King Bernard Zwirn's fingers tapped the desk in front of him. He muttered to himself a couple times and then he let out a short sigh. Benjamin noticed that King Bernard Zwirn's eyes did not move away from Snark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need to check on something in that dream,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;I'll be back in fifteen minutes. You can hang out here and watch the screens until I come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin didn't know why King Bernard Zwirn was being secretive. It was obvious that he was going to the dream that had Snark in it. But, Benjamin didn't know why. He didn't know if Snark was in trouble for having led Benjamin into Castle Ehtahl. All Benjamin knew was that he had not seen King Bernard Zwirn that serious before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;I can wait here. But, can I come along with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you'll have a lot more fun if you stay here,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said. &#8220;Look at all these dreams! And besides, I'll only be gone for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Benjamin did not know exactly what was happening, the dreams were so interesting to him because he could see into the minds of people sleeping throughout the world. There was a person chasing a lion. An older woman was standing in front of a classroom. A young man was riding a motorcycle in a desert. And then, the screen which had been showing Snark flickered and then went dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did Snark go?&#8221; Benjamin asked the people working behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over there,&#8221; someone said from the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over where?&#8221; Benjamin answered with his hands at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Near the broom closet on the right,&#8221; the same voice shouted back among all the other shouts.</p>

<p>So, Benjamin decided to walk to the broom closet which was just next to the last column of screens. If this meant he would not be in the way, he would gladly stand next to some brooms. King Bernard Zwirn would be back soon enough, Benjamin thought, and he could not wait to ask him many questions about Snark. He wanted to know everything.</p>

<p>A hand gently rested on Benjamin's left shoulder and he was thrilled to realize that King Bernard Zwirn was back. His first question, he decided, was to ask where Snark and all of the dinosaurs went after the dreams were done. But when Benjamin turned around, he saw quickly that the hand did not belong to King Bernard Zwirn. It belonged to Russell Fox, the man who prevented Benjamin from reaching the train station. And standing behind Russell Fox was Thalia Nachamie, a sinister looking man wearing all black and smoking a long pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Benjamin,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie said in a menacing voice.</p>

<p>Benjamin turned to run toward all of the workers but Russell Fox grabbed his shoulder and made a sign with his finger that Benjamin had better be quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't run, Benjamin,&#8221; Thalia said in a long drawn out voice. &#8220;I'm here to watch the dreams, with you. Do any of them interest you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet, Benjamin. We have to watch the dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to leave me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will. I will. But, not right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin did not want to speak with this man. He wanted King Bernard Zwirn to return as soon as possible. He strained his neck to look for the king but he couldn't find him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, my name is Thalia Nachamie and I am, how should you say, very interested in you. You see, the king and I have a bit of a disagreement as to how dreams should be made in Castle Ehtahle. It'll be resolved in no time, don't you worry about that. I'll get my way. I always do. But first, I have a question or two for you,&#8221; Thalia said. &#8220;What kind of child leaves their home to go to someplace unknown? Did you not know what you were getting yourself into? Did you not know what would be on the other side? Tell me, Benjamin, why are you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin paused and looked back and forth throughout the workers for someone who could help him. No one seemed to be looking in his direction. They were all preoccupied with the dreams on the screens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silent, aren't we?&#8221; Russell Fox said. And at that moment, Benjamin realized that it was the same voice that had told him to go to the broom closet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'd like you to leave me alone,&#8221; Benjamin said sternly. He was scared because he was defenseless against two people who made him feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll leave you alone, Benjamin,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie said. &#8220;But if you don't have a good reason for why you came here, I'm left to assume that you came here for something. And, you're not willing to tell me what that something is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came here for adventure,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly as he tried to wrestle his arm away from Russell Fox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adventure?&#8221; Thalia Nachamie echoed with a laugh. &#8220;Why of course. You'll find adventure here. But you're after something more, aren't you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin got one hand loose and started to move away but Thalia grabbed his neck with a strength that Benjamin had never felt before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie said. &#8220;I'm just going to warn you once, Benjamin. There is no room for someone like you here. We don't take kindly to people who want to change the way we do things around here. I know what you're trying to do. I know what you want&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not trying to change anything! I don't know what you're talking about!&#8221; Benjamin yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop being so childish,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie said as he released Benjamin to the ground. &#8220;But do realize, I have my eye on you and I don't take kindly to people who aren't honest with me. You had better stay out of my business, Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thalia Nachamie and Russell Fox stared angrily at Benjamin as they walked into the hallway and disappeared. Benjamin could still feel the tight grip from Thalia Nachamie. He didn't know what they were talking about. Why did they think he was trying to change something? Why were they so suspicious of him?</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said as she reentered the room. &#8220;Are you ok?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Russell Fox was here and he--&#8221; Benjamin started to say. But as he began to speak, a loud noise erupted from one of the screens and several employees stood and pointed in the direction. King Bernard Zwirn jumped up and began issuing new commands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isolate it!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Isolate eight five zero!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's spreading,&#8221; a worker yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut it down,&#8221; the king responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; someone yelled back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, shut it down,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said quickly.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at screen eight five zero. There was chaos. A man was hitting everyone in the scene and causing violence everywhere. He was acting ruthless and without concern for anyone's safety. And then, a gigantic monster entered the studio and began wrecking havoc upon everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something is wrong,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn whispered to himself but in a voice loud enough for Benjamin to hear. &#8220;We've never seen a nightmare as strong as a nightmare like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nightmare?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a nightmare,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said when he realized Benjamin was listning. &#8220;And, I fear it was the strongest nightmare I've ever seen. I'll keep you safe, Benjamin. Don't worry. I won't let those nightmares get you.&#8221;</p>

























<h1 id="chapter10">Chapter 10: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A King Kidnapping</h1>

<p>Benjamin lay awake in bed staring into the darkness above him, wondering how worried his parents were that he was not at home. He also wondered if Mr. Marchetta even knew that he was gone. Being away from his family was causing him to miss them more; but being away from his school had quite the opposite effect. In fact, if it was not for his family, he could see himself living  in Castle Ehtahl for a long time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pssst,&#8221; a voice in the bunk next to him sounded. &#8220;You awake?&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice belonged to none other than Ralph Eden, who Benjamin had become accustomed to knowing as the other boy in the dormitory who did not sleep at night. Ralph frequently used his flashlight to read books that were prohibited on school grounds. The only books the students were allowed to read during their personal time were books that had been written with incredible creativity and imagination. Books that downplayed excitement and fun were prohibited. They were the equivalent of poisoning the brain, King Bernard told them. They belonged to the nightmares.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Benjamin said without moving. &#8220;I'm usually awake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don't you sleep?&#8221; Ralph asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know how to sleep here,&#8221; Benjamin replied. As the words left his mouth, he realized this was true. When he was home, he could easily prepare himself to sleep by imagining his favorite dreams. But here, he was forgetting them and was unable to prepare himself to sleep. He couldn't save the world from Professor Undutois.</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes awhile to get used to not being able to dream,&#8221; Ralph said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not being able to dream?&#8221; Benjamin rolled to his side and stared into further darkness. &#8220;You can't dream?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could months ago but I haven't had a dream since the dream machine stopped working. My dreams were amazing. I was conquering land after land and building bigger and bigger castles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened? What did you stop dreaming?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't choose to stop dreaming. When our dream machine broke and we learned we only had a limited supply of dreams left, everyone in the castle had to give up their dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave up dreaming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. And, that's why you can't dream either,&#8221; Ralph said. &#8220;There's no more dreaming here. No more dreams until the machine is fixed. King Zwirn has been searching for whoever broke it for months. He still can't find the nightmare responsible for ruining everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, why don't you just fix the machine?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ralph laughed and Steven Wazen on the other side of the dormitory shushed to tell him to be quiet. Steven could sleep as well as all the other students in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can't just fix the machine,&#8221; Ralph said. &#8220;If we could fix it, don't you think we would have fixed it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess. I mean, I would hope that would be the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right. We can't fix it because it's broken and there's a piece missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin knew the appropriate question to ask next but decided to let silence handle the conversation because he did not want to be seen as dumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, your next question,&#8221; Ralph continued. &#8220;Must be why don't we just make another piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Benjamin answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the answer to that question is that the dream machine has over one hundred thousand pieces. We do not know which piece is missing, at least that's what the parents in town tell us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't believe them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not that I don't believe them. But, if this machine has been here for centuries, surely someone must have written down all of the pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe there is a blueprint for how to make another one,&#8221; Benjamin suggested without really knowing what he was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; Ralph replied quickly. &#8220;But, Aloysius has it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aloysius!&#8221; Benjamin said loudly. Steven Wazen on the other end of the room shushed more loudly than he had earlier. Benjamin lowered his voice and in tandem, tried to lower his enthusiasm for learning more. &#8220;Who is Aloysius?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't talk about it,&#8221; Ralph said between his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone keeps saying that,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;But, I don't understand why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you knew why, you would understand why we don't talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin rolled onto his back and continued to stare into the darkness. He thought about Aloysius Trenhaile over and over and over. Without any details to create him in his mind, he tried to imagine what a person would look like that everyone else would not want to talk about. The only person that came to mind was Howard Horne. And, Benjamin decided, not thinking about anything was much better than thinking about Howard Horne.</p>

<p>Footsteps slowly made their way closer and closer to Benjamin's bed until a figure stood at the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;You guys have to be quiet,&#8221; Steven Wazen said with disgust. &#8220;Just because you can't sleep, doesn't mean we can't.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly. &#8220;We'll be quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you dreaming?&#8221; Ralph asked with a smirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was dreaming of dreaming,&#8221; Steven replied with a laugh.</p>

<p>As Steven returned to his bunk, Benjamin closed his eyes and decided that although he was happy not being at school, he wanted to be able to dream. He decided he would ask King Zwirn how he could help fix the dream machine in the morning. Maybe, Benjamin thought, he learned something from his father making repairs to their house.</p>

<p>The lights in the dormitory flickered on and off until they stayed on. Benjamin looked at the large clock on the wall and noticed that it was four o'clock in the morning. It was two and a half hours earlier than they normally woke up. The lights never turned on before it was time to start the day.</p>

<p>All of the boys sat on their beds and looked at the clock with even more worry than Benjamin had. They glanced at each other and every one of them had an identical curl in the brow, mirroring each others confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have to wake up!&#8221; a brash voice yelled at the end of the dormitory. &#8220;Have to wake up now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked and saw Noel Jaffin, King Bernard Zwirn's body guard, standing in the doorway with heavy armor covering his body. He looked like a metal cube, heavy enough that he could not be moved easily. And although the sight of a metal cube person was rather funny, Benjamin was a little unnerved that everyone else was unnerved. Noel Jaffin did not wake up the boys. That was Miss Lindenmeyer's responsibility. And when Miss Lindenmeyer woke up the boys, she did not appear dressed in armor. Noel Jaffin was not prepared for a day of learning. He was prepared for battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!&#8221; he said as he pounded his short legs back and forth into the ground.</p>

<p>Slowly, boy by boy arose and got changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry!&#8221; Noel Jaffin yelled to the young children. &#8220;This is not a drill!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A drill?&#8221; Benjamin said aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were told a day like this might happen,&#8221; Ralph said with a tiny feeling of exhaustion. &#8220;I guess today is that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What might happen?&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;What's going on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just follow orders,&#8221; Ralph replied. &#8220;And, you probably will be fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys lined up and Noel Jaffin checked their names on a sheet of paper on a clipboard as they passed him. In each case, Noel Jaffin had to stretch his neck backwards in order to see which child was which. As usual, Benjamin was last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I've decided that I'd like to help King Bernard Zwirn,&#8221; Benjamin said as if Noel could somehow make this a reality.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're not going to help King Bernard Zwirn,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said quickly and matter of factly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I'd like to speak with King Bernard Zwirn about the dream machine,&#8221; Benjamin continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're not going to talk to King Bernard Zwirn about the dream machine,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, when can I talk with him?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He's gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin stopped. All of the boys in the line stopped. It was worse news that any of them had thought they would hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, gone?&#8221; Steven asked forcefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that King Bernard Zwirn has been kidnapped. I am here to take you to your class. No more questions. Silence while we walk,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said as he marched to the front of the line.</p>

<p>They marched at a slower pace due to Noel's short stride from hallway to hallway in complete silence. But despite not being able to hear the thoughts of the other children, Benjamin could feel that something had gone so wrong that these otherwise happy and energetic children had suddenly become scared and concerned.</p>

<p>As they made their way past the classroom, Noel Jaffin led them to another hallway decorated with paintings on all walls, ceilings, and even the floor. Benjamin stepped carefully from painting to painting of old men and women who lived in this castle previously. And oddly, each expression on their face looked more dire than the expressions he had noticed on their faces earlier.</p>

<p>Noel reached a painting of a woman wrapped in a red flag on a white horse whose two front legs flew into the air against a background of tan rocks that matched tan clouds. She pointed to the top left hand corner of the canvas. And that was where Noel Jaffin punched his fist through the canvas and pulled on a hidden lever, revealing an old circular staircase leading down below.</p>

<p>Each of the boys filed one after the other while Noel Jaffin, again, checked their names against a piece of paper on a clipboard. Benjamin, again, was the last to depart but he decided this time that it was not in his best interest to ask Noel any other questions. Instead, he wondered how many other secret passageways existed in this castle. And, he wondered how many other secrets there were in general.</p>

<p>As he stepped down each curved stair, he imagined that they were descending several floors below the ground. It was dark, lit only by candles on the walls, mounted against cold rocks that were moist from whatever rain water had fallen below. After having turned six or seven times, Benjamin found himself at the end. He stood at the opening of a massive, cavernous room that looked like it could hold as many people as he ever thought existed. There were people everywhere.</p>

<p>In front of him, Miss Lindenmeyer stood with the girls from the class. As Miss Lindenmeyer welcomed the boys to join the girls, Selma Applebaum took a step forward. Benjamin knew, before she said anything, that she was the angriest of everyone in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all Benjamin's fault!&#8221; she screamed.</p>





















<h1 id="chapter11">Chapter 11: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Flying Machine</h1>

<p>Benjamin felt his body freeze. His face had no color and his arms felt like cement. He had just been blamed for King Bernard Zwirn's disappearance. But worse than having been blamed, Benjamin couldn't believe something happened to King Bernard Zwirn.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Benjamin wasn't here,&#8221; Selma Applebaum said sternly. &#8220;This would never have happened!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Lindenmeyer restrained Selma and pushed her to the back of the room. Benjamin did not know where to look.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I do? Did something happen because I came here?&#8221; Benjamin muttered quietly to Miss Lindenmeyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not your fault, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she cautiously pushed Benjamin towards the rest of the class. &#8220;You didn't understand what coming here meant. You didn't do anything wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did King Bernard Zwirn disappear because of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, Benjamin. This has nothing to do with you,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said calmly.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked around at the other students but none of them wanted to make eye contact. It was as if all of the kids around him thought that Benjamin would disappear if they did not see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; Benjamin asked Miss Lindenmeyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;You're going to be here for a little bit longer than I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin began to panic. He felt like King Bernard Zwirn was a friend. And, that friend held the key to get him home. Benjamin wasn't eager to get home. But at that moment, he didn't know how it would be possible to leave without the king.</p>

<p>As Benjamin stared off in the distance, Miss Lindenmeyer held her class as she had before. It was difficult for him to pay attention because there were people walking around and talking about what may happen next. The distractions were endless and Benjamin began to fear the worst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Today, we're going to play with flight machines. We normally wouldn't but this space just so happens to have one of the tallest ceilings around, which makes it incredibly safe. No one is going to be flying to the moon,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said.</p>

<p>The students were happy about the idea of using flight machines. Benjamin did not know what they were but he was intrigued when Noel Jaffin wheeled a long  rack of odd shaped machines to Miss Lindenmeyer. They looked like a combination of a motorcycle engine and a chair, each of them painted green.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Noel,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;Now students, grab a flight machine. Make sure you get your correct size.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin watched all of the students pick their flight machines and when it was his turn to pick his, there was only one engine left. He was not sure if it was his size or not. So, he took it and hid behind the other students.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer began to say with some caution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin shouldn't be allowed to use the flight machines,&#8221; Selma said sternly to Miss Lindenmeyer, without addressing Benjamin himself.</p>

<p>He took a step toward the rack to return the device.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's fine,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said quickly and abruptly. &#8220;Benjamin, watch Selma sit on her flight machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma was quite upset that she had suddenly been partnered with Benjamin. And Benjamin was quite concerned that his safety was being entrusted to someone who hated him. It was not a great partnership by any means.</p>

<p>Benjamin watched Selma quickly settle into her flight machine and turn the ignition switch on. It made a louder noise than Benjamin expected but was not so loud that he needed to cover his ears. It sounded like a mechanical hummingbird would hum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, we're going to fly one at a time,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;Because we don't want any more mid-air collisions, right Ryan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Lindenmeyer had the students line up in front of her. One by one, she inspected the flying machines to make sure that they were working properly. She did not want a disaster. Benjamin watched her inspect the machines like a mechanic had inspected his parents' cars at home. Then when Miss Lindenmeyer was finally satisfied that everything appeared to be in order, she went to the first student and nodded with approval.</p>

<p>Steven Wazen flew into the air and his flying machine's engined churned a fine, soft buzz. It was not like the sound of a motorcycle or the sound of a locomotive. It was like the sound of a microwave and a kettle of boiling water. Benjamin watched Steven turn the flying machine to the left and then to the right and then to the left again. He flew fast, then slow, and then fast again. It looked almost graceful, Benjamin thought, as student after student flew into the air and around the room.</p>

<p>To Benjamin, the entire ordeal, so far, was both exhilarating and frightening. This was actually some of the adventure that he was hoping to find. He wanted experiences that were different than his experiences at home and certainly, there were not many flying apparatuses at home. And yet when each student successfully landed, he became more and more scared as he realized it would next be his turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said with the same confidence and enthusiasm she had said to all of the other students. &#8220;Let me show you how this works.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Lindenmeyer sat on the flying machine, pressed an ignition button, and then slowly ascended into the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once you get this high,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer shouted as she began to turn around in the air. &#8220;You lean forward to go forward. You lean backward to go backward. Left to go left and right to go right. It's actually quite easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it magic?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Selma shouted from behind him. &#8220;This isn't magic. This is science. That's an engine. It's not some fantasy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma's right,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she landed and then promptly adjusted her hair. &#8220;It's just science. We have a lot of machines here that you probably don't have in Pennsylvania. They help us create more vivid dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin wanted to stall a little longer. He was not feeling as confident as the other students felt about flying one of these machines. Even if he was able to get the flying machine into the air, he felt he would then be defenseless and visible to all of the people on the ground who currently hated him. Certainly, someone would throw a rock or some fruit, he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think this is a good idea, Miss Lindenmeyer,&#8221; Selma protested as she flew into the air and coasted along the walls of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It'll be fine, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer reassured him. &#8220;The machine does most of the work for you. Now, just have a seat. And, I have a remote that's going to control your flight.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nudged Benjamin into position, tied his seatbelt tight, and then fastened his helmet. As soon as he looked like someone who would soon take flight, Miss Lindenmeyer hit the ignition button without warning Benjamin ahead of time. He felt a sudden jerk of the engine and a sudden beat of his heart. The machine raised Benjamin further and further into the air where Benjamin had a view of the sheer number of people in the room. It was tens of thousands over a length larger than his neighborhood. Although he still felt more comfortable on the ground, flying was more fun than he expected.</p>

<p>As Miss Lindenmeyer advised, he moved forward as he leaned forward. He moved backwards as he leaned backwards. The machine sensed his movements and handled everything for him.</p>

<p>He even grew enough confidence that he relaxed his tight grip on the handlebars and looked to the students below. Selma Applebaum, along with the rest of the class, had their arms crossed in front of them and their lips tightened as well. Benjamin wanted to fly for hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer yelled. &#8220;I'm going to turn off the machine from my remote control. You'll descend in a second.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Lindenmeyer inspected the remote and clicked a few times until the engine of the flying machine stopped. Benjamin waited to get back to the ground, entrusting his teacher to his safety. His teacher, though, looked at Benjamin with confusion and then looked back at her remote with more confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's off,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;You should be ascending.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked to the rest of the class whose contorted faces had suddenly taken on the same confused look that Miss Lindenmeyer showed. He was ascending further and further into the air.</p>

<p>Miss Lindenmeyer became more worried. She ran for a closet on the near side of the room. Benjamin looked to see where she was going and the flying machine turned with him. He pointed the engine down and it started to go down. Maybe, he thought, the remote did not work in this dark hall.</p>

<p>He watched his teacher return with a long rope. She turned one end of it into a lasso. The other students uncrossed their arms and now had their hands on their hips. Benjamin did not know what to make of their expressions other than something peculiar had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch the rope when I toss it to you,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer yelled.</p>

<p>She threw the lasso up in the air and Benjamin grabbed it when it was near. She pulled and pulled and pulled with all her strength and Benjamin descended to the ground. As soon as he placed his right foot on the ground, the flying machine jerked and fell suddenly to the floor.</p>

<p>Miss Lindenmeyer was exhausted, Benjamin saw. And the students, they were perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, everyone,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she continued along with her class. &#8220;Let's get lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone filed in a single line and started to march onward. As Benjamin passed Miss Lindenmeyer, she placed a hand on his chest so that he stopped walking forward. She looked from side to side as if she did not want anyone else to hear what she was about to say. Benjamin leaned forward so that he could hear her whispers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can't leave my side or view,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer whispered. &#8220;You're in a lot of danger.&#8221;</p>























<h1 id="chapter12">Chapter 12: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is Evil</h1>

<p>Over the next week, everyone in class treated Benjamin differently. He noticed that Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen watched him as if they were hawks staring at a little mouse. Selma Applebaum refused to make eye contact with Benjamin. But, it was impossible to ignore a student who was able to fly a machine when it was not powered on.</p>

<p>&#8220;That hasn't been done before,&#8221; said one student. &#8220;How did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;I just kept sitting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you do that with other machines?&#8221; another student asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Benjamin responded again. &#8220;I don't know what other machines exist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you related to King Bernard Zwirn?&#8221; another student asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don't think so,&#8221; Benjamin answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be amazing if you were,&#8221; another student stated. &#8220;Imagine we have in our class a student who is a relative of the man who made all of the dream machines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bernard Zwirn made all of these machines?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;His dad did,&#8221; Selma said as she continued to look forward at the chalkboard while all of the other students continued to look backward to Benjamin. &#8220;But, he's gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Bernard Zwirn is his son?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Selma said. &#8220;He's one of Bernard Zwirn's three sons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are the other two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't talk about it,&#8221; everyone said in exhausted unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's life like in Pennsylvania?&#8221; another student asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's fun,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;It's not too different than living here I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there people everywhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And lots of food?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And people can do whatever they want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the most part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And everyone has dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;But, I guess you would know better than I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Students,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she entered the classroom wearing a raincoat. &#8220;We have to go to the general assembly area for an announcement. So I need you to line up in a single file and head outside. Raincoats on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Student after student put on their coats and filed from the classroom outside into the unforgiving rain. There were people exiting every building, all headed in the same direction toward the gigantic dream machine. Benjamin wondered what all of these people did each day. He did not know what every person in Pennsylvania did and he imagined students felt the same way about Castle Ehtahl. There were tens of thousands of people of various ages and sizes and colors gathered in one big plaza. The dream machine hovered over them like a tree that had spiralled upward without casting a single branch.</p>

<p>Benjamin followed Steven Wazen and noticed that Miss Lindenmeyer, who led the group of students, frequently turned around to make sure that she could see him. When they reached a spot in the plaza with enough space for the class, Miss Lindenmeyer positioned everyone in rows and then stood next to Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not to leave my side,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is happening?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not exactly sure,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer responded. &#8220;But, it's probably related to Bernard Zwirn's disappearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does this happen often?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Selma replied. &#8220;Bernard Zwirn liked talking to small groups of people rather than everyone at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, who is going to speak now?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>Selma shrugged her shoulders as if she did not care. At the front of the plaza, before the tens of thousands of people, was a green and blue stone building that towered almost nearly as high as the dream machine. The building reminded Benjamin of cathedrals he had seen pictures of before. But, this building was much wider and much more detailed than any cathedral he had ever seen. At the very top, there was a balcony with a red flag hanging over the entrance.</p>

<p>As rain poured down, projection screens were hastily opened throughout the plaza. Cameras turned on and focused themselves on the balcony. Lights flickered and flashed from all directions as soundchecks began to test the limits of the speaker system. A hush came over the crowd as Castle Ehtahl's anthem began to play. It was a song that reminded Benjamin of jazz songs his dad would play on the radio while working on the family car. The rhythm was quick and the song was incredibly upbeat, Benjamin thought. It felt inspiring, even though Benjamin knew none of the words.</p>

<p>When the song ended, the lights dimmed and a roar spread across the crowd from the back to the front. Even Benjamin got caught up in the excitement of what was to come. He noticed, however, that Miss Lindenmeyer was not energized at all. Her eyes were glancing from left to right in a fast enough manner that suggested that she was looking for someone. Benjamin realized she was nervous and that made him nervous. He trusted Miss Lindenmeyer more than he trusted the crowd. And without King Bernard Zwirn, Benjamin looked to Miss Lindenmeyer for help.</p>

<p>On the balcony, the red flag was removed by two guards who looked to be about the same size as Noel Jaffin. The crowd erupted in anticipation like Benjamin had seen at music concerts on television. Benjamin expected, for reasons he could not explain, to see something magical happen. Maybe, he thought, King Bernard Zwirn would return.</p>

<p>A man did enter but it was not King Bernard Zwirn. It was Thalia Nachamie. And behind him, Russell Fox stood at attention.</p>

<p>The crowd erupted in excitement and cheers and Benjamin was more confused. He did not see any reason to cheer for either of these people. No one else must realize that Russell Fox was the reason that Benjamin was still there. And, Thalia Nachamie had threatened Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;My fellow Ehtahlians,&#8221; Russell Fox projected into a microphone. &#8220;I present to you the interim King, Thalia Nachamie.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd screamed and cheered. Miss Lindenmeyer did not flinch and Benjamin noticed that Selma Applebaum did not flinch as well. The other students in the class cheered as loud or louder than the people around them. And at that moment, Benjamin began to realize that everyone may have been cheering only because everyone was cheering and not because of the men who stood on the balcony.</p>

<p>Thalia Nachamie glanced from side to side with his long face and his crooked nose. His dark black hair was seamless with the black clothes he wore and the black hat on his head. He looked, if Benjamin could name an animal, like a large crow that wore pieces of leather rather than feathers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentleman,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie's voice boomed across the plaza as the rain continued to pour down. &#8220;A great tragedy has come to our castle. Our very own Bernard Zwirn has been kidnapped. We do not know where he was taken and we do not know who has taken him. But, we will find him. And until we do, we will continue to do what we do best.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cheers erupted throughout the crowd and Benjamin's face turned pale as he heard confirmation of all the rumors of the past week. King Bernard Zwirn was kidnapped. It was, he thought, one of the worst possible answers to where the king may have been. Kidnapping, to Benjamin, meant that there was very evil in the castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We set a search party to look for Bernard Zwirn. We don't have many clues so if anyone knows what has happened, please contact me directly and I'll make sure to tell you whether your clue is valid or not. As you all know, if Bernard Zwirn is not found in another week, we will have to move on without him. We cannot wait around endlessly for his return. We don't have time. Our dream machine is running low.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thunder cracked in the distance and the rain became more fierce. Miss Lindenmeyer placed a hand over Benjamin as her eyes continued to move back and forth. But then, her eyes stopped. Benjamin saw that she was looking to the left but he could not see what she had found.</p>

<p>&#8220;If anyone has any questions at this time, please ask them now,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie projected to the audience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a chance anyone else could be kidnapped?&#8221; Russell Fox asked into a microphone behind Thalia Nachamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's a great question,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie continued. &#8220;And there is a severe chance that every one of you could be kidnapped. So, it is important that you continue to do your jobs well and that you do not wander outside of this castle. If we cannot fix the dream machine, we will have to use another proposed solution. This proposed solution, as I told you last year, will make sure that you can make dreams and not be kidnapped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the dream machine be fixed?&#8221; Russell Fox asked into the microphone again. Benjamin could see that Russell Fox was reading from a tiny sheet of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is again a great question,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie began. &#8220;We are missing a piece to the dream machine and we do not know what this piece is or where this piece is. It's possible that the dream machine has suffered damage beyond repair. But, we do not have any way of knowing whether we can fix it without having this piece returned to us. If you know the evil, villainous person who has stolen it, you must tell us immediately. We will not stand for evil in our castle.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;What will we do if we run out of resources to make dreams?&#8221; Russell Fox asked again, in the same tone and awkward reading style as the previous two questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another great question,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie started. &#8220;We will not run out of resources to make dreams. If the dream machine fails, I will make sure we have the resources to make more dreams. You can count on that. I think that's it for questions. Have a great day everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thunder crashed and Benjamin was surprised that Thalia Nachamie ended his question and answering session because there were over a hundred hands raised throughout the plaza. Selma had her hand raised too and took it back down with disgust. Miss Lindenmeyer was still looking to her left and Benjamin noticed that she was trying to talk to someone by mouthing words and reading lips. He still could not see who she was speaking with.</p>

<p>As the crowd started to depart in various directions, Miss Lindenmeyer ushered the students back to the school where she was met by another teacher Benjamin had not seen before. Benjamin started to walk into the school but then Miss Lindenmeyer grabbed his hand. He saw that Selma was watching everything that was about to transpire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quickly, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Lindenmeyer and Benjamin ran back into the crowd, which made Benjamin quite nervous. He did not know who to believe and who to trust other than Miss Lindenmeyer. Any of these faces looking upon him could belong to the person who kidnapped King Bernard Zwirn. They zigged and zagged between one dark clothed body and another, getting wet from the rain along the way.</p>

<p>Benjamin stopped. In the distance, he saw him.</p>

<p>It was Snark. It was Rodney Cohen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Lindenmeyer!&#8221; Benjamin yelled. &#8220;That's the dinosaur that led me here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Lindenmeyer looked in the direction that Benjamin pointed. Rodney looked confused and concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said with a long sigh. &#8220;We have to run, Benjamin. I'm going to introduce you to Rodney Cohen now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She grabbed his hand as a person would who was pulling an unwilling partner. Benjamin looked back over his right shoulder and watched Rodney walk toward them. His heart beat faster as he realized he would finally meet his favorite dinosaur. He didn't know what to say. He had waited for this moment his entire life. And, it was finally here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, there, um, Benjamin. Sorry, I, uh, kind of, you know, got you here, when, um, you know, the King's missing and all,&#8221; Rodney Cohen said exceptionally awkwardly. He kept rummaging through his hair like he knew he did something wrong. It was not, Benjamin thought, the welcome he had dreamed of.</p>

<p>First of all, Rodney Cohen was a person and he wasn't wearing the Snark costume. And Benjamin realized that he didn't like Rodney Cohen as much as he liked Snark. Snark was confident and powerful and inspiring and adventurous. Rodney Cohen was awkward and goofy and irresponsible and lazy. Benjamin was speechless.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know seeing me, you know, um, without the, uh, custome, er, the, uh, you know, I mean, what I'm trying to say is, that, well, I'd rather, you know, greet you as Snark, not, uh, well, not, um, not me,&#8221; Rodney Cohen said as he shifted his weight back and forth.</p>

<p>Benjamin stared at Rodney Cohen and let out a long sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I kind of wish you were Snark right now,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at Rodney Cohen as if he was a stranger. And, Miss Lindenmeyer appeared to recognize this because she interrupted the quite awkward conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney, there's something you need to know about Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said while making sure no one around her listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, really? What is it?&#8221; Rodney said curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can't talk here,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said as she glanced from side to side at the thousands of people walking among them. &#8220;Let's go to the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin wondered what was so special about him. He also wondered how someone so lanky and awkward like Rodney Cohen could be so confident and powerful as Snark. How was it that one person could be two different things? It seemed impossible to Benjamin. No one could be both.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin can fly on a flying machine without power,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer whispered to Rodney Cohen as they walked forward.</p>

<p>Rodney quickly glanced at Benjamin and his confused face turned into excitement. He gave Benjamin a huge thumbs up and tried to give him a high-five before Miss Lindenmeyer pushed down his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, Rodney! I was teaching the class to fly on the flying machines,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer continued. &#8220;Benjamin went up as well and I controlled his flying machine from a remote control. When I turned it off and had Benjamin come back to the ground, he continued to fly around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe the remote control was busted,&#8221; Rodney said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn't. I tested it again that evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe there were strong winds. I know I get in lots of trouble in strong winds. I can get stuck up there for hours even.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he had a remote control of his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney, please. He didn't have a remote control of his own. I'm only telling you this, not because I want to, but because you brought Benjamin here and you're going to have to help me protect him. If Thalia Nachamie learns of this, Benjamin is going to be in incredible danger. Thalia Nachamie will either enslave him or kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rodney examined Benjamin as they continued to walk. Benjamin was confused why this guy was going to help protect him. He looked like he was only a decade older than Benjamin and not many more years older in maturity. But, Benjamin couldn't forget that Snark saved him during the nightmare he had. Maybe, Benjamin thought, Rodney could help him afterall. </p>

<p>&#8220;Sweet!&#8221; Rodney Cohen yelled. &#8220;I'll hide the little man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;Do you know where Bernard Zwirn is? By chance, did you have anything to do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Rodney said as he waved his hands back and forth. &#8220;I love King Bernard Zwirn. I wouldn't do such a thing. I want him back. Unfortunately, it seems Aloysius Trenhaile doesn't like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aloysius?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh sorry little dude, we don't talk about it&#8221; Rodney replied. &#8220;But, um, yeah Aloysius kidnapped him.&#8221;</p>




















<h1 id="chapter13">Chapter 13: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Clue</h1>

<p>Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen waited for Benjamin to wake up in the dormitory before they began firing questions at him. They had been waiting for about thirty minutes, watching Benjamin sleep. Little did they know, however, that Benjamin was doing his best to sleep as long as he could. He realized that being awake was only causing him trouble and that sleeping would allow him to pass time more quickly. The two children waiting for Benjamin to wake did not know his plan. And having the personalities that they did, they grew tired of waiting any further. They grabbed Benjamin's bed and began rocking it from side to side.</p>

<p>Obviously, Benjamin could not sleep through what was essentially a simulation of an awful boat ride. His eyes flew open and his body shifted forward as he signalled that he had had enough. But Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen had not noticed because they became more occupied with shaking the bed than waking up Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you guys doing?&#8221; Benjamin asked as he rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to wake up,&#8221; Ryan Eden said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't have to wake up,&#8221; Benjamin replied. &#8220;There's no school today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you were going to have to wake up at some point,&#8221; Steven Wazen added with a snicker. &#8220;And besides, we've got some questions we want answers to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone has questions for me,&#8221; Benjamin said as he found clothing to change into. &#8220;I don't want to answer any more questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin walked across the dormitory as Steven Wazen and Ryan Eden followed like two snakes stalking a prey. Benjamin felt unease about their presence because they obviously had questions that he did not want to answer. And even though he could not stand up to Russell Fox or Thalia Nachamie, he also knew he could not stand up to Steven Wazen or Ryan Eden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just one question, then,&#8221; Steven Wazen continued, unphased by Benjamin's request for silence. &#8220;Why is it that you want to be friends with dinosaurs?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin paused because that question was more unexpected than all of the questions that raced through his mind. But he wondered what Steven Wazen was getting at because Ryan Eden laughed uncontrollably behind him. He could answer this question, he decided, because he was not scared of what he would say.</p>

<p>&#8220;We go on adventures together,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;They are my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, they're in your dreams,&#8221; Steven Wazen said. &#8220;They aren't real.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know they're in my dreams,&#8221; Benjamin replied. &#8220;And, I know they aren't real. But that that doesn't stop me from dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Steven Wazen said quickly. &#8220;We all know the story of how you got here. But you don't realize that you didn't see a dinosaur. You saw Rodney Cohen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know Rodney,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly. &#8220;Miss Lindenmeyer introduced me and Rodney's been showing me what dreams he acts in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Benjamin. You don't know how much trouble you're in, do you? You can't be that dumb?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin paused for a moment because he knew from his experience dealing with Howard Horne that there was no good answer to that question. If he responded that he was not dumb, that would be the expected response. But if he responded that he knew who the danger he was in, he would be lying. He wanted to know why he was in danger. He didn't understand but Steven Wazen was certainly not going to explain it to him. And so, Benjamin turned around in hopes that the question and the two boys would disappear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentleman,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said as he entered the dormitory wearing less armor than on previous days. Noel cleared his throat several times as if there was something lodged between his pumpkin body and his bowling ball head. &#8220;Benjamin, follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you taking him?&#8221; Ryan Eden asked as he walked towards Noel Jaffin.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's none of your business, Ryan,&#8221; Noel said despite being nearly a foot shorter than the boy. &#8220;Benjamin, you are to follow me at once. Let's go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You're always escorting him. You're never escorting any of the other kids. It's not fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noel shook his head in annoyance at Ryan Eden. Benjamin smiled inwardly as he passed the two boys and although he was not thrilled to see Noel Jaffin, he was thrilled to leave the dormitory. Whenever Noel Jaffin appeared, Benjamin knew that something had happened that was not very good. It was as if Noel Jaffin's arrival was a message alone that trouble was near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; Benjamin asked Noel Jaffin.</p>

<p>&#8220;We,&#8221; Noel Jaffin stated as he tried to lengthen his walking distance to match that of Benjamin's, &#8220;are not going anywhere. I am going home to watch the football game. You are going to meet Miss Lindenmeyer and Rodney Cohen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, there's no school today,&#8221; Benjamin protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a smart one,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said sarcastically. &#8220;But danger doesn't rest on the weekends and you've got a date with a lovely women and, um, well, a dude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, fine,&#8221; Benjamin said because he did not want to hear any more.</p>

<p>Noel Jaffin escorted Benjamin through a series of buildings and hallways that Benjamin had become more accustomed to seeing. He did not know which one it was but he knew that the guard was taking him to a production studio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, how do nightmares get in here?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh I don't know,&#8221; Noel Jaffin grumbled through his mustache. &#8220;I suppose they come in here a lot like you came in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin thought about that answer for a second because only at that moment did he realize why he was confused earlier as a nightmare. If nightmares entered the way he entered, of course everyone would assume that he was one. It made logical sense.</p>

<p>Noel reached his arm above his head and grabbed a doorknob to open. It was studio two thousand and two.</p>

<p>&#8220;In you go,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said as he began to shuffle Benjamin forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, Noel,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;Aren't you going in too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over here!&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer yelled from the far side of the production studio. &#8220;Come over here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, away we go,&#8221; Rodney Cohen shouted as he turned on a flying machine and soared into the air. &#8220;I never get tired of this!&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved every which direction as Miss Lindenmeyer used another machine to create clouds on the ground. Miss Lindenmeyer then turned on a fan which blew the clouds in the air so that Rodney could fly between them. Miss Lindenmeyer and Rodney were both laughing and Benjamin thought that it did look like fun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this all fake?&#8221; Benjamin asked them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer asked. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this all fake? Are dreams not real?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Benjamin, I think you're in a state where you can answer that question as best as I can. What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know anymore,&#8221; Benjamin said distantly. &#8220;Well, that's not true. I'm pretty sure this is all fake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, if it's all fake, why don't you just go home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know how! King Bernard Zwirn has the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can't be all fake, right? I mean we dream for a reason. We don't dream fake dreams. The dreams are real.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin did not know but he thought that perhaps Miss Lindenmeyer had a point. If it was all fake, then dreaming would be pointless, he thought. And, he liked dreaming.</p>

<p>Rodney landed the flying machine next to Benjamin and then promptly brushed off the dust from his jacket. Rodney was always happy. Even though he looked nothing like Snark, there were some characteristics that Benjamin saw in both of these creatures. Rodney was brave, Benjamin admired.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's been decades since I've used any of these old machines,&#8221; Rodeny said. &#8220;I've been using newer models lately. It's fun to go back into time and try an old one again. These things have character, you know? They, um, don't work as well as the, uh, new ones. But they still work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer began. &#8220;We asked Noel to bring you here because we want to show you how to use more these machines. Rodney wants to see if you can fly again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to fly?&#8221; Benjamin asked with concern. &#8220;I promise you that I don't know how to fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Rodney said. &#8220;And, I can't either. Fly, that is. But perhaps under the right circumstances, you might be able to do something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With one of these machines?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, with one of these machines. You don't have to start with the flying engine. You could try any of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This one,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said, &#8220;is made for surfing a gigantic wave. You won't get wet at all but you'll be able to surf with ease.&#8221;</p>

<p>The machine looked like a metal basket sewn together with copper, steel, and iron. Orange lights lined the outside and blinked in a fluid dance. It looked mechanical yet organic and heavy yet light. Like all the other machines that sat next to it, it looked like someone had spent years piecing each individual component together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hop on!&#8221; Rodney said with youthful enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;I'm not sure I'm ready to use these machines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;Once you start it up, you don't have to do anything. You just enjoy the ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at the machine and wondered if it would bite him or guide him. Rodney nudged Benjamin from behind but Benjamin did not move. Miss Lindenmeyer budged him and he still held his ground. He did not want to get involved with these machines. He didn't want to sit on something that looked like a torture device.</p>

<p>But when both Rodney and Miss Lindenmeyer pushed Benjamin together, he fell forward into the arms of metal and lights. The machine enveloped him like a mechanical kangaroo would hold its baby. Without asking or telling him, Rodney pushed hard on the ignition switch and Benjamin moved to an area of the production studio where the floor was beginning to separate down the middle. As the divide grew larger, water began to rush through in powerful waves that would have been perfect for an experienced surfer. It was not, however, ideal for a boy who was pretty much scared of everything.</p>

<p>The machine touched down on the water and Benjamin could not believe what was happening. He was surfing, albeit with a lot of help. But, he was actually surfing. This was something he did not imagine was possible. And more than that, he was awake and having fun.</p>

<p>He surfed for what felt like hours and then Miss Lindenmeyer told him to turn the machine off. It guided him back to the women who had their hands crossed and their smiles strewn from ear to ear. They looked as happy as Benjamin looked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I try another?&#8221; Benjamin asked with curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; Rodney said. &#8220;That one will let you float in the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin ran to the machine that looked like a large mechanical crow with thousands of pieces. He turned it on and then started to float throughout the room. Miss Lindenmeyer sent clouds into the air and Benjamin felt like he was experiencing something much more enjoyable than dreams. He felt like he was experiencing something magical.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is he doing up there!&#8221; Selma Applebaum yelled from the entrance of the production studio.</p>

<p>She stamped her feet as she walked to Miss Lindenmeyer. Behind her, Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen marched with their arms folded and their eyes squinted. Benjamin fell from the sky upon seeing them and landed on a soft padding.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you three doing here?&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know why he is allowed to use these machines and I am not,&#8221; Selma protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, this is none of your business,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;You need to leave immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We told you Miss Lindenmeyer wouldn't let you use the machines,&#8221; Ryan Eden said from behind Selma. &#8220;Benjamin is being trained to be the top student in the class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don't want you to be the best anymore,&#8221; Steven Wazen said to Selma Applebaum.</p>

<p>Benjamin did not know what to say because he did not know if that was Miss Lindenmeyer's intentions. He saw Rodney roll his eyes and then walk back to the machines. Selma must have seen him roll his eyes as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh stop it, Rodney,&#8221; Selma said.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at her and wondered how she knew Rodney. It was impossible to know everyone in the castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You always get so jealous,&#8221; Rodney said. &#8220;If dad was still around, you wouldn't barge in like that. What's your problem with Benjamin?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma didn't say anything. Tears swelled in her eyes. She turned around quickly and ran from the production studio. Ryan Eden and Steven Wazen did not waste any time and chased after her. Rodney and Miss Lindenmeyer simply sighed and gave expressions of disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're Selma's brother?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by choice!&#8221; Rodney replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a choice?&#8221; Benjamin questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, uh, no, but, um, I'm a lot older than she is and we don't always get along. She gets so jealous. She just wants to be the best and hates when someone else might be better than her,&#8221; Rodney explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;She's jealous of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep! Listen, Benjamin,&#8221; Rodney said as he crouched down. &#8220;I'm not too much older than you and I'm really sorry about you learning about Snark and the dinosaurs. It was never my intention that you see me this way. I mean, look at me. I don't look courageous, confident, or brave. That's Snark. Snark is courageous, confident, and brave. I'm lanky, awkward, and different. So, I apologize and I need to help you out. It's probably the only thing I'll be able to do. And I'm not sure I can help you out other than tell you this. But, Benjamin, if you're to save yourself, you've got to dream. Actually, to save all of us, you've got to dream. Benjamin, you've got a gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gift?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But anyone can use these machines,&#8221; Benjamin said as he looked at the thousands of machines spread across the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's correct,&#8221; Rodney said. &#8220;But, you are the only person we know who is able to use these machines while they are turned off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I turned them on before I used them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; Rodney said. &#8220;Every one of them was turned off. You can someone fly on your own, surf on your own, and do whatever on your own. I don't know how you can do it. But, man, Benjamin, if you know who finds you, you're going to be in so much trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? Who is going to find me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The person who broke the dream machine.&#8221;</p>



























<h1 id="chapter14">Chapter 14: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is An Opportunity</h1>

<p>Benjamin feared for his safety. He walked around aimlessly in the dormitory, thinking about what he could do. He needed to find out who was trying to hurt him. He needed to figure out what happened to King Bernard Zwirn. He needed to know why Rodney Cohen and Miss Lindenmeyer believed he had a gift. And, he needed to know why Selma was so jealous of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you walking back and forth like that?&#8221; Benjamin heard the familiar voice of Selma shouting from down the hallway. He was so lost in his thoughts that he completely ignored her voice. There was too much to think about. &#8220;I said, where are you going?&#8221; she shouted again.</p>

<p>Selma walked to Benjamin and stood in his path. But, Benjamin didn't see her. He continued to pace back and forth. It was like there was nothing else around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you deaf?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I asked why you are walking back and forth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm tring to figure out what to do,&#8221; Benjamin declared. He turned and continued to walk past her.</p>

<p>Selma followed his pacing and laughed lightly to herself as she did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what exactly are you trying to figure out?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven't figured it out,&#8221; Benjamin said honestly. &#8220;I need to know who is trying to get me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma laughed again, more lightly this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need to know where King Bernard Zwirn is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma nodded her head with approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need to know why I have a gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma let out a disgusted expression of disapproval. At that moment, Benjamin stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, I need to know why you're jealous of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma stopped walking after him and she let out a loud gasp. He noticed that she was not happy with his observation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not jealous of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You definitely are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am most certainly not!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin could see that Selma was becoming uncomfortable. She laughed in a way that suggested she was trying to conceal her uncomfort. And so, Benjamin tried to change the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case, it's just one of many things I have to figure out.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, Selma would not let him change the subject so easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a second! I am not jealous of you, Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Benjamin said as he walked past her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why would you think I would be jealous of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like I said, I don't know. I've got to figure that out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there's nothing to figure out. I'm not jealous of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might be right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am definitely right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what if you're wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I be wrong? I just told you I'm not jealous of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could be lying to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a ridiculous conversation. I am not jealous of anyone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You're probably right. But, I still need to know why you were upset that I was using the machines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There's nothing to figure out! There's nothing there, Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, it's not the top thing on my list. I've got to figure out who is trying to hurt me. That's definitely the top thing on my list.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you wouldn't care if I was jealous of you then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, you aren't. You said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, but if I was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I still would rather know who is trying to kill me before I figured out why you're so jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not jealous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, we're on the same page.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma stumped on the ground and let out a loud, long sigh. She flung her arms in the air, spun around in place, and then marched away from Benjamin. Benjamin watched her walk down the hallway. At the very end, she turned to look at Benjamin and let out another loud, long sigh of frustration. Benjamin didn't understand why she acted the way she did.</p>

<p>After Benjamin was done pacing for the day, he went outside to try to find Rodney Cohen. He needed to ask Rodney if the dinosaurs could help him find King Bernard Zwirn. As he walked around the castle, people brushed by him from every direction as they walked about their day. Some walked to the production studios, some walked to the market, and some walked to the cafes and bakeries that had opened only an hour earlier. It was a little chillier than usual that morning but it had been colder in general since King Bernard Zwirn's disappearance.</p>

<p>He marched forward to the gate on the other side of the town that would lead him to somewhere else. He walked past the school, past the dream machine, past Bernard Zwirn's house, and past the train station. And as he passed the train station, he closed his eyes as he realized that the building looked no different than any of the other production studios. As he wondered why the train station looked similar to all of the other production studios, a hand grabbed his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; Ryan Wazen said without pausing for a second. &#8220;Could you fly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I fly?&#8221; Benjamin asked. He was confused why Ryan Wazen was being a little more aggressive than usual. &#8220;No, I couldn't fly,&#8221; he lied. &#8220;Flying is impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;Flying is impossible but that doesn't answer my question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a silly question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it's not. Could you fly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I couldn't fly,&#8221; Benjamin lied for the second time. &#8220;No one can fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People can fly but if you can't, I guess that's a shame. Miss Lindenmeyer was wrong about that kind of stuff before. Don't take it too hard, kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean in the past?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About kids that she thinks can fly. They usually can't. Some of them could, I was told. But, we never saw them again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do they go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn't you like to know,&#8221; Ryan said as he started to walk backwards from Benjamin. &#8220;You don't have to worry about it because you can't fly. Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to. That's what my dad always told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ryan ran off and Benjamin tried to follow him but the classmate was too fast. Benjamin did not have a good feeling about Ryan. There was something that he didn't know about him. Ryan had a secret, Benjamin thought.</p>

<p>Benjamin stared at the castle walls for a period of time and wondered what was on the other side. It was so difficult to understand how everyone behaved inside the castel that he wondered if there were answers outside the castle walls. He walked to a gate, deciding that he needed more information. Guarding the gate were two men who looked identical to Noel Jaffin. They both had the same box shaped figure and short stature. Benjamin thought that if they did not let him pass, he might be able to quite easily topple them over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; the guards yelled in unison. &#8220;If you pass, it will only be by gas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you pass--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard what you said,&#8221; Benjamin responded. &#8220;I didn't quite expect you to say that. I'm leaving, Noel, so I would appreciate if you would open the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Noel?&#8221; asked one of the guards as he stamped his wooden pole into the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you Noel?&#8221; the other guard asked the previous one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not Noel. I'm Joel. Are you Noel?&#8221; Joel asked the other guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not Noel. I'm Cole. Haven't we met?&#8221; Cole asked Joel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We stand here every day and we've never introduced ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's nice to meet you,&#8221; Joel said to Cole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same!&#8221; Cole said he shook Joel's hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you shall not pass unless you are gas!&#8221; Joel and Cole yelled at Benjamin in unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think you realize what you're saying,&#8221; Benjamin said as he tried not to giggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only way you're getting through us is if you're gas,&#8221; Joel said sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know but you're saying--&#8221; Benjamin began.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall only pass if you're gas,&#8221; Cole repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, I need to leave,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; they yelled back in unison. &#8220;No one leaves!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin thought about this statement for a moment. Did he mean anything to anyone in the castle? Was he someone? Or, was he no one? He wasn't sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am <i>no one</i>. Can I leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cole and Joel looked at each other with a puzzled expression. They looked as if they were pondering something their brains were not capable of understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is interesting,&#8221; Cole said to Joel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Interesting indeed,&#8221; Joel said to Cole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could this be the <i>no one</i> that is allowed to leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's quite possible that if<i> no one</i> is allowed to leave and this child before us is <i>no one</i>, he could leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That seems right to me as well but how do we know that he is <i>no one</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He just said he was <i>no one</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, right. But would <i>no one</i> lie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good point, Joel! <i>No one</i> tells the truth all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So then, <i>no one</i> is a liar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This child is <i>no one</i> the liar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>No one</i>, you shall not pass!&#8221; they yelled in unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there another gate?&#8221; Benjamin asked. He did not want to have to deal with Joel and Cole any longer. He was getting a headache.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, there are four more,&#8221; Cole said as he stamped his wooden pole back into the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are four more!&#8221; Joel said with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really think we need a better onboarding process,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;I don't know who guards those gates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me neither!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin walked along the walls at a quick speed to find another gate. He did not want to have to deal with Joel or Cole if he could find an easier way to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck, <i>no one</i>,&#8221; Cole cried out after Benjamin.</p>

<p>Benjamin walked between the castle walls and the back of small houses and production studios. It was a narrow alley that felt neglected compared to the rest of the clean town. It was muddy and there were bits of garbage tossed throughout. It made sense, he thought, because no one walked along this path. As Benjamin walked further, he wondered if the only people who would traverse this disgusting, claustrophobic path were the guards who tended the gate.</p>

<p>He had been walking for a good period of time and did not yet see another gate. The curved walls of the castle made him think the he might walk a full circle to see Joel and Cole again.</p>

<p>His left foot stepped into wet mud that sucked his foot deep into the ground. He quickly moved his right foot to a rock and tried to pull his other foot forward. It was gross and disgusting and Benjamin knew that he would have to throw his shoes away after this was all done. It made a loud squishy noise like the sound he made when he tried to vacuum the water out of the bathtub when he was six.</p>

<p>It started to make him laugh.</p>

<p>And, he would have continued to laugh except that he heard another familiar voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, what if I don't want to,&#8221; Benjamin heard Ryan Eden say. &#8220;I'm not as good as the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn't matter if you're stronger or better than the others,&#8221; Benjamin heard Thalia Nachamie say. &#8220;You are my son and you will follow in my footsteps. No other person or child is going to get in your or my way. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin crouched as low as he could to the mud as he realized the noise was coming from the house immediately to his left.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, father. I'll follow in your footsteps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I've already paved the path for you. Rodney Cohen has been dismissed. He'll be seeing King Bernard Zwirn, shortly. You won't be seeing him again and there is no chance that he'll get in our way again,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie said.</p>

<p>Benjamin's heart sank as he wondered what had happened to Rodney. He had just seen him yesterday.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Selma?&#8221; Ryan Eden asked his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won't have to worry about Selma,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie said. &#8220;Soon, I'll be King. And then, you'll be King. This is a glorious time for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, father,&#8221; Ryan Eden said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, run along,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie said. &#8220;I have to do some things to get ready for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin kept his little body as close to the wet, sticky mud as possible so that he could avoid being seen. He was scared for himself. And also, he was scared for Rodney Cohen. He wanted to know what happened to him and why Thalia Nachamie got rid of him. He did not know that Ryan was Thalia Nachamie's son. But, it made more sense. Ryan was evil afterall.</p>

<p>It was hours before Benjamin moved. For that period of time, he was as still as a clay statue.</p>

<p>The sun set on the other side of the castle and cast a shadow over the path. Benjamin would be hidden by the darkness, he thought, but only if he moved quickly. With his left foot hovering above the ground, he counted to three and then sprinted along the path. The castle wall moved so quickly that he wondered if he could run this fast forever. He would have to because he did not know what was on the other side. He was prepared, he thought as he ran, to blast through whoever stood at the end.</p>

<p>With the exit in sight, Benjamin ran faster and faster.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes but then he ran straight through someone. The collision felt like the collision he had when he was younger and accidentally ran into the basketball pole at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in all that is good are you doing?&#8221; Noel Jaffin yelled at Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin! What is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noel had been knocked over like a beanbag chair thrown down a staircase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, is that really you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Benjamin. It is me, Noel. Who else would it be?&#8221; Noel said. &#8220;Now, would you mind telling me why you ran me over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, Rodney. Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noel's expression changed and he looked from side to side quickly. He lowered his tone and he voice a lot.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can't talk about that here, Benjamin,&#8221; Noel said. &#8220;He's missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Missing!&#8221; Benjamin yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Lindenmeyer, too,&#8221; Noel said as he lowered his head.</p>

<p>Benjamin's heart sank.</p>

<p>&#8220;How? Where?&#8221; Benjamin yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet! Quiet!&#8221; Noel whispered. &#8220;Yes, you're in a lot of danger. It's good I ran into you. I wish you didn't run into me. But, I need you to wait here. I parked my car on the other side of the market. I'll be right here in five minutes. Do not move a muscle, OK?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin nodded as he looked at the hundreds of people moving throughout the marketplace. Noel disappeared into the crowd and Benjamin decided that he could trust the guard. He couldn't leave just yet, he thought. He needed to make sure he was going to be safe. There was no one here any longer that he completely trusted.</p>

<p>As Benjamin waited, he scanned across the people in the marketplace and recognized a face. Benjamin retreated into the shadow so that he could not be seen. It was Russell Fox.</p>

<p>Russell Fox was walking very suspiciously. He was wearing a long dark jacket and had both his hands in his pocket as he moved from market shop to market shop. Benjamin watched him very carefully because he knew Russell Fox was trouble. As Russell Fox turned in place, Benjamin got a glimpse of something metal that Russell Fox held in his right hand. And then, Russell Fox walked to a stand covered in oranges and stood there for a few minutes. Something was very wrong, Benjamin thought. Russell Fox then stuck his right hand in the middle of the oranges and walked away quickly, in the opposite direction of Benjamin. And as he walked away, Benjamin noticed the metal piece was no longer in his pocket.</p>

<p>As soon as Russell Fox faded into the crowded, Benjamin snuck quickly through the crowd to the gigantic stack of oranges. He put his hand into the oranges as the shopkeeper stared at him with an annoyed expression. Benjamin tried to be calm about it. He tried to find the place where Russell Fox placed his hand.</p>

<p>Then, he felt something metal.</p>

<p>He grabbed it and waited for the shopkeeper to be distracted by another customer. Benjamin removed it quickly and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>He knew exactly what it was.</p>

























<h1 id="chapter15">Chapter 15: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That Benjamin Is Blamed</h1>

<p>&#8220;Noel!&#8221; Benjamin yelled as the overweight guard drove a vehicle only slightly larger than his body to Benjamin. His car looked like a square, metal box in which Noel occupied just about the entire space. Once he parked, he leveraged all of his weight forward to get out of the vehicle like an elephant trying to squeeze itself out of a refrigerator.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Benjamin?&#8221; a sweaty Noel answered as he brushed the dust from his pants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, I found something that could help me and help Castle Ehtahl and probably get King Bernard Zwirn, Rodney Cohen, and Miss Lindenmeyer back,&#8221; Benjamin said as he gripped the missing piece in his pocket. He didn't know, really. But, he thought the dream machine would transform the castle and drive away the nightmares once again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right. Right. I've heard this before. Let's just get you to the police station so we can figure out what to do with you next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't understand. This could answer all of our problems. The mystery of the missing piece of the dream machine is over,&#8221; Benjamin said as he opened his hand to reveal the missing object.</p>

<p>Noel did not look convinced. He crossed his arms and tightened his lips, ultimately ending his bored performance with a heavy sigh. He picked the piece from Benjamin's hand and inspected it from every angle.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is scrap,&#8221; he said as he tossed it over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Benjamin ran after it and caught it before it hit the ground. If the missing piece broke, then the dream machine certainly would not work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, this is the missing piece. We can put it in the dream machine and it'll start working again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you so sure? This is scrap metal. This doesn't mean anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can't we at least try?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try what?&#8221; Steven Wazen said from behind Benjamin.</p>

<p>Benjamin did not know how long Steven Wazen had been standing behind him or how much he had heard. At that moment, Benjamin wanted to focus only on getting this metal component into the dream machine. He was worried that Steven Wazen might distract from this goal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, Steven,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said in response. &#8220;Just another person among hundreds of thousands thinking they are special enough to have found the missing piece of the dream machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinks he's found the missing piece to the dream machine?&#8221; Steven Wazen asked as he stood immediately next to Benjamin. He had a skeptical and accusational expression that made Benjamin's stomach clench. &#8220;How long have you had it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have I have it?&#8221; Benjamin asked with a startle. &#8220;I've only just found it. I found it in the market. We have to see if it fits because this could answer all of our problems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I see it?&#8221; Steven Wazen asked.</p>

<p>Benjamin paused. He did not want to give it to anyone else after having watched Noel Jaffin carelessly toss it over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; Steven Wazen continued. &#8220;Let me see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin stared into Steven Wazen's eyes and then glanced at the ground. Before he could hide the piece, Noel Jaffin let out a loud groan and yanked it from Benjamin's hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't understand kids these days,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said to himself as he gave Steven Wazen the component. &#8220;Here. Here is the scrap metal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steven Wazen inspected it in exactly the same way Noel Jaffin had just examined it. But unlike Noel Jaffin, Steven Wazen's expression became more and more intrigued and curious. It was as if he was understanding something that Benjamin could not see.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's scrap metal,&#8221; Steven Wazen said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said. &#8220;Now, Benjamin, let's get a move on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I have it back?&#8221; Benjamin asked Steven Wazen who still held the metal piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll dispose of it for you,&#8221; Steven Wazen said as he put it in his pocket and quickly ran away.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said. &#8220;That was really nice of him to offer to get rid of it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin was irate. He wanted to run after Steven Wazen but the boy had already become hidden by the crowd in the marketplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, that was the missing piece!&#8221; Benjamin said in complete disbelief. &#8220;He took the missing piece for the dream machine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's scrap metal, Benjamin. You're not the first person to claim to have found the missing piece. You're actually the seventeenth person who claims to have found one today. Or, eighteenth. I'm not sure. The sooner we get you to the station, the sooner we'll know what number you are,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said as he ushered Benjamin to the small car. &#8220;Now, we're going to have both fit inside here. You get in first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at Noel Jaffin with disapproval. There was no room for anyone else in this car once Noel Jaffin was inside it.</p>

<p>It was the most uncomfortable car ride that Benjamin had ever experienced, his face squashed between the window and Noel Jaffin's hot, squishy belly. His legs were on top of each other and he could not move his arms. When they arrived in the station's parking lot, Benjamin felt like his body had been damaged in every place. It was excruciating and upon seeing Selma Applebaum at the station, embarrassing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; Benjamin asked Selma as he tried to straighten himself out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was arrested,&#8221; Selma Applebaum said without flinching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Selma Applebaum said as she walked past him. &#8220;I was searching for Miss Lindenmeyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel told me she's missing. Rodney Cohen is missing, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is,&#8221; Selma Applebaum replied. &#8220;Noel asked me to stop in the station to talk to some of the other guards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where she is? &#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Selma Applebaum said. &#8220;But, I have a good idea who is responsible for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't tell you now. But for your own safety, you better stay out of sight. You're making quite a few enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm making quite a few enemies!&#8221; Benjamin exclaimed. &#8220;I've been nice to everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not everyone thinks that's the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin,&#8221; Noel Jaffin called from his office on the other end of the station. &#8220;Get in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See you later, Benjamin,&#8221; Selma Applebaum said as she left the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, wait! I forgot to tell you--&#8221; he started to say but it was too late. Selma Applebaum had already left and could not hear him. He should have mentioned what he found.</p>

<p>Benjamin walked along the blue carpet lined with yellow desks and cubicles until he reached Noel Jaffin's office. The room was, sadly, only slightly larger than Noel Jaffin himself. Benjamin paused at the door, let out a large sigh, and then squeezed his way between a small space between the desk and a wall. There was only a little bit more space than there was in the car. But unlike the car, Benjamin and Noel Jaffin sat face to face, only inches away from touching.</p>

<p>It was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, we've got to find a way to hide you for a bit,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said.</p>

<p>Benjamin wanted to end this conversation as fast as possible so that he could leave the office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, OK. Let's do it,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright, so I'll just arrest you and we'll put you in a jail cell for the time being. No one is going to bother you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait. Arrest me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, I'll arrest you for assault or something. I'll tell people who you hit me. Ouch!&#8221; Noel Jaffin said with a hearty chuckle. Benjamin could feel the heat of the laugh on his face. It was disgusting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can't you just put me in a jail cell?&#8221; Benjamin asked. He couldn't believe he asked the question because he did not want to be in a jail cell at all. There must be a better option, he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said while shaking his head. With each turn of his neck, Noel Jaffin almost hit Benjamin with his nose. &#8220;We can't put innocent people in the jail cells.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I am innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but that's why I said I would tell people who you assaulted me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I haven't assaulted you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's true. OK, hit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit me,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said as he squinted his eyes and lifted his shoulders in preparation of Benjamin hitting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not going to hit you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Punch me in the face!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin wanted to punch Noel Jaffin in the face. But, he knew he couldn't do it. If he went to jail for a crime that he did in fact commit, he would be in even more trouble than he was now.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won't!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said as he opened his eyes and relaxed his body. &#8220;I'll just tell people  you punched me in the face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I didn't. Can't you put me somewhere else than a jail cell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no other place in this castle that is as safe and secure as our jail cells. No one will bother you there. The only other place is the zoo but I don't think you'll like it there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a zoo?&#8221; Benjamin asked with curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it's over--&#8221; Noel Jaffin began to say until a woman twice Noel Jaffin's size entered the doorway.</p>

<p>Benjamin swallowed hard. There was no more space in this office. He would be crushed if she wanted to sit inside the room as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, may I have a word with you?&#8221; the enormous square woman said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, boss, sure,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said to her. &#8220;Stay here, Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noel Jaffin squeezed his way out of the office, crushing Benjamin between the desk and the wall. His body had not endured so much torture as it had from this large man in such small environments. Benjamin breathed heavily in an attempt to get his body back in order. The office walls had pictures and books that had been squashed like flies against white paint. A plant looked like it was flattened against the window and Noel Jaffin's chair looked like it had been through several battles. It was losing the war against Noel Jaffin's weight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said as he reentered the doorway. Benjamin hoped that Noel Jaffin and his boss were not about to both enter the office. &#8220;We have to go for a castle meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, I'll be here,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you're coming along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure that's a good idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I need to keep an eye on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked to the plaza and as they approached, Benjamin saw the entire castle's population standing and sitting around while some workers scrambled to erect screens and speakers. Noel Jaffin did not have the same expression of worry that Miss Lindenmeyer had the last time Benjamin was here. Instead, he kept looking at his watch while shuffling a candy bar in his other hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this for?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know exactly,&#8221; Noel Jaffin replied. &#8220;But, it better not get in the way of lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When is lunch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When isn't it lunch?&#8221; Noel Jaffin said with a hearty laugh. &#8220;Twenty minutes. Lunch is in twenty minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked around the audience for someone he knew but like last time, did not see anyone. There was no Miss Lindenmeyer. No Rodney Cohen. No Selma Applebaum. And, no Steven Wazen or Ryan Eden.</p>

<p>Rather, there were strangers everywhere. And in unison, those strangers stood and jumped with excitement. A roar of cheers waved across the people as Benjamin looked to the balcony to see who was going to appear.</p>

<p>It was Thalia Nachamie. Benjamin expected him. Who else would it be?</p>

<p>But then, two more people stepped onto the balcony. Benjamin did not expect to see them. His heart slowed with a little worry.</p>

<p>It was Ryan Eden.</p>

<p>And behind Ryan Eden, it was Steven Wazen.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they doing up there?&#8221; Benjamin muttered to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said as he nudged Benjamin. &#8220;We're going to find out if they've found King Bernard Zwirn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? They wouldn't find King Bernard Zwirn. They're the reason King Bernard Zwirn is missing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet! Quiet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thalia Nachamie hit his hand against the microphone three times, causing all of the speakers around the audience to pop in response. He leaned forward and with his long, crane-like nose hooking over the microphone began to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not found our beloved King Bernard Zwirn,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie said to the cries of the audience below. &#8220;But, our efforts are not in vain. We are continuing to search for him. We search in the night. We search in the day. We are searching all the time. And so, it is with my deep regret that I must inform all of you that the time has come to move on. WE cannot keep searching for King Bernard Zwirn forever. It is with great courage that I tell you today that I must be made king. It is not by my choosing, of course. It is to make sure that dreams are available to all that go to sleep at night. You see, without a King, this castle does not have a leader. And without a leader, there are no dreams. And, I must be that leader. Today, I present myself, King Thalia Nachamie, the leader of Castle Ehtahl.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Thalia Nachamie stopped talking, the crowd remained silent for a few seconds until Russell Fox began to clap. When Russell Fox clapped, people around him started to clap. And then, people around those people started to clap. And this persisted until the entire audience was clapping for Thalia Nachamie, their new king.</p>

<p>&#8220;My followers, I want to let you know that even though I am now King, that does not mean that we will stop looking for Bernard Zwirn. In fact, it is quite important that we continue searching for our friend. But good people, there is one person among all of you who is hindering our progress. There is one person among all of you who does not want us to find Bernard Zwirn. There is one person who is trying to steal from us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gasps and whispers spread throughout the audience. Even Benjamin wondered what Thalia Nachamie was alluding to. If anyone was in the way of searching for Bernard Zwirn, Benjamin thought, it was Thalia Nachamie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only this morning, I was made aware of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thalia Nachamie turned around and Steven Wazen handed his father the missing piece of the dream machine that Benjamin had only hours earlier given away.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's the piece,&#8221; Benjamin told Noel Jaffin.</p>

<p>&#8220;The what?&#8221; Noel asked as he looked at his watch again.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's the missing piece of the dream machine that you said was scrap metal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was scrap metal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn't!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looked like any scrap metal I've ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noel Jaffin looked forward, squinting his eyes to see what Thalia Nachamie was holding.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is someone in this audience who had the missing piece of the dream machine all along,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie's voice echoed through the plaza. &#8220;This person did not want us to have it. This person kept it from all of us. This person kept if from you. He wanted to keep it for himself. He wanted to make sure the dream machine never worked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Russell Fox,&#8221; Benjamin whispered to Noel Jaffin. &#8220;That's who I saw put it in the market stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shh, quiet down,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said to Benjamin. &#8220;I may have to make an arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone in our castle is preventing us from making dreams. Someone has been putting us through turmoil all along. Someone wants to stop us from dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>The audience stirred.</p>

<p>&#8220;But my followers, I am proud to say that we have identified the person. And, we are going to exile him from our castle. He is no longer welcomed here and we will not have him among us any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cheers and applause echoed throughout the plaza. Benjamin strained his neck to see where Russell Fox was, but he was not standing in the same location as he was before. Benjamin looked in every which direction to find where the thief went.</p>

<p>&#8220;That person will be punished! We will get back our dreams!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd screamed loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be removed! We will be stronger than ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd raised their fists in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is no longer welcome here!&#8221; Thalia Nachami raised his fist into the air as he finished each sentence. &#8220;We are going to be wealthier than ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd cheered. Benjamin swallowed hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin Buckingham, I banish you from Castle Ehtahle!&#8221;</p>






















<h1 id="chapter16">Chapter 16: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That Benjamin Is Banished</h1>

<p>Benjamin felt a wave of worry surge through his body like a breeze blowing through a wind tunnel in a city. He could not leave, he thought to himself, because he did not know where he would go to. He knew where he was and that, he believed, was better than not knowing where he could be. Without anyone he trusted around him, he felt isolated, alone, and vulnerable. He felt feelings he knew from school, feelings that did not make him happy, feelings from which he wanted to flee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you OK?&#8221; Selma Applebaum said.</p>

<p>It was confusing to Benjamin because he did not expect Selma to be warm or empathetic to him. She wasn't, he thought, but he did notice that she had her arm on his shoulder and this, he thought again, was confusing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm OK.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You're pale white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like white white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's just that I've never seen someone so white and be OK. Are you sure you're OK? You look like you've seen a ghost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin thought about all of the ghosts he had battled in his dreams with his dinosaur friends. He was never fearful of the ghosts. He never turned pale white or white white or confused or worried or scared. With his friends, he had all the confidence he needed to stand up to evil. But without any friends, he had nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going outside,&#8221; Benjamin stuttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yup.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yup?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah, no, sorry, I mean,&#8221; Selma scratched her foot into the ground and stared at a rock a few feet away. &#8220;You'll probably be fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll probably be fine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want me to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know! Lie to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It'll probably be a wonderful experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A wonderful experience? Are you insane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or it might not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you have those expectations--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, I don't know if you're being mean to me on purpose or if you're trying to tease me or what but--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not trying to tease you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked hurt and Benjamin recognized that the words he spoke were like daggers being thrown at her. They would be stopped by her shield, he thought. Selma still had a shield in front of her and until she lowered it, Benjamin did not know whether he could trust her or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, it's just that--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, you have no idea how often I've--&#8221;</p>

<p>She couldn't finish her sentence because Thalia Nachamie began to shout above everyone once again. He moved his head from side to side like a bird perched on top of a tree, staring at everyone below him like they were mice in a farm field. And all Benjamin could do was try to hide behind the other mice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin Buckingham,&#8221; Thalia Nachamie walked to the castle doors. &#8220;You are hereby banished from this castle and you are never to return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thalia Nachamie emphasized what he said by thrusting his clenched first forward and spitting after every word. Benjamin felt like he was being verbally and physically attacked. He could not imagine how he could escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you understand me?&#8221; Thalia Nachamie stared deep inside Benjamin's eyes.</p>

<p>Benjamin nodded meekly. He wanted it to stop. He wanted to wake up in his bed and for all of this to end peacefully. He wanted to be rescued. He wanted Snark.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall never return!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not be welcome back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall live forever with nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nightmares?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave! Now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thalia Nachamie turned to the guards standing behind him. Noel, Joel, and Cole all turned a steel wheel as quickly as their short bodies could turn something much larger than they. The wheel was nearly double their size and as one of the guards pulled, another was lifted up into the air until he let go.</p>

<p>Noel, Joel, and Cole opened the door nearly halfway when Thalia Nachamie motioned for them to stop. The guards were dripping in sweat and breathing like dogs who chased tennis balls for hours. Thalia Nachamie had decided that there was enough room for Benjamin to exit.</p>

<p>Then, all of the people in the plaza turned their heads and stared at Benjamin like sunflowers looking toward the sun. He had never had such attention in his life as he had at that moment. He was the most popular person in the castle and he felt like he was the least liked.</p>

<p>He took one step forward and Selma Applebaum tugged at the back of his shirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck,&#8221; she whispered before running deep into the crowd of scarecrows staring at Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be gone with you!&#8221; Thalia Nachamie yelled as he pushed Benjamin through the door. &#8220;Don't ever come back!&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind him, the guards trampled on top of each other to close the door. Benjamin listened to the straining metal door as it whined in pain. When it was finally closed, it let out a short thud.</p>

<p>And then, Benjamin heard applause and cheering that sounded as loud as the noises he heard when that dragon was captured. The plaza of still people erupted in happiness and excitement at the expense of Benjamin's feeling. This hurt Benjamin's heart. He did not want to be hated. No one wanted to be hated. But Benjamin especially did not want to be hated.</p>

<p>Maybe Selma was right, he thought. Maybe he just had to think everything would be OK. He would have to believe it. It was fine, he thought to himself, because he would never see those people again. He could finally go home. This was his opportunity to leave. He was no longer confined by the walls of the castle. He was free.</p>

<p>But as he looked at the area outside the castle, he did not know exactly where to continue. It was not as bright and lovely and beautiful as he had expected. Instead, it was a desert as empty as an empty swimming pool in the middle of July.</p>

<p>There wasn't a living plant as far as Benjamin could see. There was no water and no sign of any animals. There was just dirt and cracks and the sound of the sun baking the earth.</p>

<p>Benjamin was left to himself and his thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Incoming!&#8221; Benjamin heard a familiar female voice yell from behind the walls.</p>

<p>Benjamin turned and watched something in the sky heading in his direction. When it hit the ground, Benjamin saw it was a backpack. He ran over to it and opened it up to find a bottle of water and more arrows than Benjamin thought were necessary. What would he do with so many arrows, he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again!&#8221; Benjamin heard the same female voice yell again.</p>

<p>In the sky, another object headed straight for Benjamin. He ducked away as quickly as he could. This object, he realized, was a bow and a book entitled <i>A Guide To Plants Outside The Castle Not That You'll Ever Need This Because Everyone Stays In The Castle But If You Do Here's A Book For That, I Guess</i>.</p>

<p>Benjamin chuckled.</p>

<p>And with that, he was on his own. He turned and walked into the desert as alone as a person could be. He took five steps and readied himself for whatever awaited him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Selma,&#8221; he whispered.</p>






















<h1 id="chapter17">Chapter 17: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Creature</h1>

<p>Benjamin reached into the backpack for some water. The desert was unforgiving and not a place for relaxing. He put the bottle back in the backpack and upon doing so, realized that there was a piece of paper at the bottom of the bag. He took it out and saw that it was a crudely drawn map. In large letters in the lower right hand corner was the name <i>Selma</i>.</p>

<p>The castle was in the center. To the north of the castle was a forest. Selma had drawn some terrible looking trees. To the south were the words <i>Don't go here!</i> and to the east were the words <i>You'll die here!</i> and to the west were the words <i>Worse than the other two!</i>.</p>

<p>Benjamin decided that he would walk to the forest but he didn't see a forest anywhere. He didn't know which way he was walking any longer.</p>

<p>As Benjamin pondered which direction to go, he heard a faint noise from behind him. He squinted his eyes but could not see what was making the commotion. It sounded like an air conditioner getting louder and louder and louder. Benjamin squinted more and noticed a trail of dust being sent into the air by something moving along the land at a fast speed.</p>

<p>It was coming right at him.</p>

<p>Benjamin picked up the backpack and ran as fast as he could away from what was running at him.</p>

<p>The humming noise was getting louder and the trail of dust was getting closer. Benjamin ran faster but he could not run fast enough. The sound was beginning to take the shape of a siren like a police car racing down a highway. Something was going to run him over and so Benjamin crouched to the ground and braced himself for impact.</p>

<p>&#8220;North! North! North!&#8221; yelled a squirrel as it ran past. &#8220;North! North! North! North!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin opened his left eye and saw the squirrel sprint off as dust and dirt flew into the air. He had never seen a squirrel move as fast as that squirrel had moved. He also had never heard a squirrel speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! Wait!&#8221; Benjamin yelled to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;North! North! North! North!&#8221; the squirrel kept yelling in the distance.</p>

<p>Benjamin ran in the same direction but could not maintain the same speed that the squirrel maintained. It was as if the squirrel had an engine that could make it run ten times faster that it could naturally run. At least, Benjamin thought, he now knew where north was. He walked forward and about two hours later, he saw the forest on the horizon.</p>

<p>The forest seemed to be as wide as Benjamin could see. And on the edge of the desert, about a hundred feet from the start of the forest, was a wooden stand with a large sign at the top that read <i>Information Desk</i>. It was peculiar, Benjamin thought, because there was nothing else out here. He approached the stand and saw that there were maps, brochures, and even coupons for a variety of discounts.</p>

<p>But on top of the counter was a silver bell with a note that said to ring for assistance. Benjamin certainly needed assistance. So, he rang the bell.</p>

<p>The leaves of the forest swayed as if a wide wind had swept across the land. The trunks of the trees moved back and forth while the foliage on the ground moved into the air.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked into the forest to see what would happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why hello there!&#8221; Benjamin heard a voice but he could not see the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello there! How are you?&#8221; the voice said again. It was loud enough to be a person but Benjamin could not see who was speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello? How are you? Where are you?&#8221; Benjamin asked as he strained his head to look around and around.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm right here! How are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm good. How are you? Right where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here? This is the forest!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, where are you? Right now, where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I'm on the information desk. Welcome to the information desk! The information desk in the forrest! I don't get many visitors but that does not mean I am not well trained in the art of customer service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at the desk and saw a green caterpillar the size of his thumb. It was standing on its end and speaking to him through a loudspeaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're a caterpillar!&#8221; Benjamin said in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're a human!&#8221; the caterpillar responded in mock surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you can talk?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>you</i> can talk?&#8221; the caterpillar responded again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I've never heard a caterpillar talk before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me, son. You're going to see some things you've never seen before out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out here? I'm sure of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, outside the castles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Castles? There's more than one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my. You can't be from here. You've got so many questions. Where are you from if you don't mind my asking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pennsylvania,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly. The caterpillar's green face turned white and the leaves stopped swaying and the tree trunks stopped shaking. Everything had come to a standstill. &#8220;Why does everyone react this way when I say I'm from Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh! Sh!&#8221; the caterpillar yelled as it held its finger to its lips. &#8220;Don't be so loud!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen just because you're from Pennsylvania doesn't mean you have to tell people from here you're from Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, so you're from Pennsylvania. What in the universe of dreams are you doing here?&#8221; the caterpillar had its hands on its hips and was tapping its right feet on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am trying to leave. I'm trying to go back to Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh! Sh!&#8221; the caterpillar hushed Benjamin. &#8220;OK, OK. That makes sense. Why do you want to leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don't want to leave. And, I can't really. You see a king was kidnapped along with a couple of my friends. And, I need to find them. If I find them, I'll get to go home. So, I want to go home but I need to find the king to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeesh, this getting complicated. How did you ever get here in the first place?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin began to open his mouth to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what?&#8221; the caterpillar quickly responded. &#8220;It's probably best if I don't know about it. What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Myrna Delacourte. Now let me see here,&#8221; Myrna said as she rummaged through the brochures and informational papers properly organized in the information stand. &#8220;Forest. Forest. Forest. Going north. Things not to eat. Things to eat. Things best left untouched. Sorry, Benjamin. I don't have any information guides for getting to Pennyslvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't need a guide for getting to Pennsylvania. I need a guide to leave here for Aloysius Trenhaile's castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything around Benjamin went silent for a minute. Myrna Delacourte's eyes were as large as the rest of her body. She dropped the brochures and jaw a the same time. It seemed, Benjamin thought, that people outside the Castle Ehtahle spoke of Aloysius Trenhaile exactly as people inside the castle did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Myrna responded with shock. &#8220;I hope you never say that name again. I don't think you want to go there. Here. Here. Here. Let me show you some wonderful brochures about the forrest. This may not be the cleanest or the coolest or the hippest or the healthiest place but it is not the worst, either! What is that you have there? There! In your hand? What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it's a map.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm sure your maps are better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I love seeing other cartographers' works!&#8221;</p>

<p>Myrna put on a pair of glasses and made disapproving facial expressions at the map.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Myrna said as she folded the map and returned it to Benjamin. &#8220;This is certainly drawn by someone who has been out here before. It doesn't have all of the details but it certainly has enough information to get you here, to me. You're lucky to have found this place to begin with. How did you know which way was north?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A squirrel ran by screaming North! North!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Gerald!&#8221; Myrna said between her teeth. &#8220;He's so noisy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it that you and a squirrel can talk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it that <i>you</i> can talk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone taught me to speak, I suppose. My parents taught me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, some people taught <i>us</i> to speak, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's amazing! Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as you don't say where you're from or where you're going again, I'll explain a little bit. Were you in a castle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Castle Ehtahl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, OK. So, there are these castles that make dreams. Castles for day dreams and castles for night dreams. But, there are also castles that make nightmares and really, really bad dreams. Castle walls that make dreams keep the nightmares outside and keep the dreams inside. You are in between castles. This is where things or people go when they aren't wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not wanted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going to presume that you did something that's led you to be kicked out of Castle Ehtahl. Otherwise, they would have sent you back to,&#8221; Myrna looked side to side and then whispered. &#8220;Pennsylvania. Perhaps, you're currently unwanted as well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn't do anything but I was accused of doing something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, same thing. You're out here like the rest of us. All of us have either done something or been accused of doing something and now no one wants us. Or, sometimes, people just don't like us. It's hard being alone but we make do. So, we live out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do, Myrna?&#8221;</p>

<p>Myrna stared Benjamin in the eyes, standing approximately three inches tall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I killed a guy,&#8221; Myrna said sternly. &#8220;No, I'm kidding! I have to have fun out here. I don't get to see that many people. No, no, I ate an apple and apparently it was someone's very special apple and they were all like 'you ate our apple!' and I was like 'it was delicious' and now, here I am. It's not a bad life. I've got all these informational brochures ready to give to people who journey through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Myrna Delacourte let out a long sigh as her chin rested on her hand. She looked longingly out into the distance before she stopped when she noticed Benjamin was paying attention to her. Benjamin could see that Myrna did not want to be where she was. She was not as happy handing out informational brochures as she said she was. He knew she wanted to be back in whatever castle that had kicked her out.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the space in between castles, that's the space for things in transition. We're not wanted by the people who knew us. And, we haven't found anyone else who wants us yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you could apologize?&#8221; Benjamin offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apologize for eating the apple? Oh, Benjamin, if only it was that easy. I'm fine here. It's not so bad. I do miss my family but that's another thing and let's get you on your way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your fam--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, the easiest way out of here is straight through that forest. After that, you're going to have to get back into a castle so that they can get you out of here. Since you're from,&#8221; Myrna leaned over and whispered, &#8220;Pennsylvania, that means you're going to have to find the person who welcomed you here in the first place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's Bernard Zwirn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, so you have to find Bernard Zwirn and then he'll send you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's the king who is in Al--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK! OK! Say no more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Myrna Delacourte stacked several maps and brochures together and handed them to Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like a coupon book for the shopping outlets on the west side of the forest? Actually, I'm just going to include it and that way you have it. Better have it and not need it, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, I need to go straight through the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, go straight through the forest and then hang a left. You'll see signs and follow the maps. One more thing about the forest, though. You need to be aware that the trees grow and move so you need to grow and move with them. Don't get caught on your heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin waved goodbye to Myrna Delacourte and wandered into the forrest. He wondered how long Myrna had been alone by herself and how many times she dreamt of being with her family again. Benjamin paused, looked to the sky, and turned around to leave the forrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Myrna,&#8221; Benjamin said as he walked back the booth. &#8220;You said you don't get many visitors and so I was wondering if you could maybe close down the information booth for a little bit. Would you like to accompany me in my journey?.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And not be alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won't be alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll bring more maps!&#8221;</p>

















<h1 id="chapter18">Chapter 18: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Forrest</h1>

<p>Benjamin and Myrna had been walking for the better part of the afternoon before he realized that he could not yet see an exit to the forest. It seemed to him like they might be walking in circles. Or worse, it seemed like the forest actually went on forever. Myrna's nose was pointed deep into the map she held before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we're lost,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we be lost? I thought you sold maps for this place,&#8221; Benjamin replied softly as he looked from side to side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do sell maps for this place, that is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So shouldn't you know where we are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it's not like I've ever used the maps. I merely sell them to people who use them. I haven't use them myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't know if the maps are right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Myrna paused her walking as Benjamin continued. Her eyes widened with a sense of realization and she looked as far into the sky as she could.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure hope so. Otherwise, there will be a lot of lost people in this forest!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin was surrounded by trees hundreds of times taller than he, with large branches that blocked a clear view of the sky. Brown leaves rustled on the ground as green leaves combed the air above. The trees were extraordinary. Benjamin stood small and insignificant compared to their size. They climbed thousands of feet into the air like wooden skyscrapers. He needed to find the exit before the sun set, he thought, because he was not sure what was in the forrest at night. And now with his companion, Myrna, Benjamin felt a bit of responsibility towards making sure he kept her safe. Being just a caterpillar, Benjamin thought, she couldn't defend herself.</p>

<p>All of this was fine except that he wanted to leave, soon. The forest was the first of many things on the map that Myrna was reading. After the forest, there was a waterfall. Then, there was a river. Then, there was a prairie. Then, there was a mountain range. Then, a volcano. And finally, there was another castle that had information on how to get to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm exhausted,&#8221; Myrna said as she wiped the sweat from her brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to rest for a bit?&#8221; Benjamin asked. &#8220;We have been walking for quite a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would love to!&#8221; Myrna said as she plopped herself down on a leaf. &#8220;I'm also a tad hungry. Are you hungry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm a little hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm a lot hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do caterpillars eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grass, mostly. Sometimes mint. And if we're very lucky, we get a tomato leaf. Oh my you haven't lived until you've eaten a tomato leaf wrapped in mint with a blade of grass tying it together,&#8221; Myrna said as she licked her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you want some grass?&#8221; Benjamin offered as he walked to a patch of green leaves protruding from the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nah, I'm not hungry for grass. Oh! How about some berries!&#8221;</p>
xxx
<p>There were some berries on the ground and Benjamin decided that he needed to learn whether he was walking in circles or not. He gathered the berries and started to smash them against the trunk of a tree. As he tried to do so, the tree seemed to shake back and forth in such a way that none of the berries stuck. He grabbed some more berries and tried to smash them into the tree again. And again, the tree shook from side to side and the berry juice flew back into Benjamin's face. Thinking that perhaps that tree had some sort of infection, he gathered more berries and tried to smash them into the trunk of another tree. And, the same thing happened. The tree shook the berries off it. He didn't understand what was happening but decided he would try one last time.</p>

<p>He gathered as many berries as his hands could hold and ran to the tree with the widest trunk in all of the forest. He held the red fruit above his head and as hard and fast as he could, he swung his arms into the tree. The berries smashed into the trunk and then flew back into Benjamin's face just as fast as he had thrown them into the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your problem!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked around. He didn't know who asked that question but it sounded like a woman who was not too far away from him. It was a voice much deeper than Myrna's and it echoed throughout the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can't take a hint!&#8221; the voice yelled again. &#8220;Do you think it's fun to have some little creature run up to you and smash berries into your side. Don't you know berries stain?!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know berries stain,&#8221; Benjamin said as he moved his head back and forth to try to find the source of the voice. &#8220;That's why I used them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were throwing berries into my side on purpose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you? Where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You've got some nerve. I thought you'd get the gist if I shook them away but for some reason, you had to run back with more berries. More berries! Why would you think I would want berries in my side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm trying to mark the trees so that I know whether I am on the right trail or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think throwing berries into my side without asking my permission is the answer to your problem?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would solve my problem, yes. If I saw the berries again, I'd know that I was walking around in circles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, the only problem is that I wouldn't keep the berries on my side. They stain! Why would I want them on my side?!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He tried to put them on me too,&#8221; an older deep manly voice echoed from another side of the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did what?!&#8221; the woman's voice yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;He smashed berries into my side as well,&#8221; the man's voice said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is just a berry massacre, isn't it?&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;This little boy has been trying to smash berries into the side of all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me too,&#8221; a young girl's voice said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The children!&#8221; the female's voice said. &#8220;You've even tried to smash berries into the children!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shook at least a dozen times and there are still some berry on me,&#8221; the elderly man said. &#8220;It's going to take at least a few washings until I'm able to get this stain out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is just an awful day,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;There's berry stains everywhere. Don't you know how difficult it is to get berry stains off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no idea,&#8221; Benjamin said honestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask your mother,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;They're impossible. Downright impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at me,&#8221; said the young girl. &#8220;I'm pretty much an embarrassment at this point. I've got berry in my trunk that'll take weeks to get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point, Benjamin realized that he was talking to the trees but he was still moving his head back and forth because he couldn't understand where the voices were coming from. And so, he wasn't sure if the trees themselves were talking to him or if there was a group of people who were creating an elaborate joke. He didn't think it was an impossibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now he wants introductions,&#8221; the elderly man's voice said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little boy comes into the forest and makes a mess of everything and now he wants to know our names,&#8221; the female voice said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kids these days are so rude. They've got no manners and think they can throw berries wherever they want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You're preaching to the choir, Earl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, his name is Earl,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly, referring to the elderly voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh shoot, I'm sorry Earl,&#8221; said the females voice while the young girl giggled in the background.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you've done it again,&#8221; said Earl. &#8220;You were never good at keeping secrets, Bertha.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bertha?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;So now you're going to make fun of my name?&#8221; Bertha asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, I was just confirming that your name is Bertha.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it's Bertha. That's Earl. I'm Bertha. And, that's Gertrude. You know all our names so now you know who to send money to for our cleaning bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm Benjamin. I'm sorry I stained your trunks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, eh?&#8221; said Earl. &#8220;I would have thought you looked a bit more like a robin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robin, yes,&#8221; said Bertha. &#8220;I've seen many robins before and you do look a lot like them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm trying to find my way from the forest. I've been walking around for hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We've been watching you,&#8221; Gertrude said. &#8220;And you've been walking around longer than hours. It's been a couple days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Days?!&#8221; Benjamin said in surprise. &#8220;But, the sun hasn't set yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn't set over this forest. It just keeps circling and circling and circling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's exactly how I felt I was walking around. In circles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See! I would have learned this had I put berries on the trunks of trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could have learned just as well if you just asked!&#8221; said Earl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;I didn't think I'd get an answer if I asked a question into a forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's true,&#8221; Bertha said. &#8220;There's that group in the midwest of the forest that's rather rude. They probably wouldn't have told you. You should have put berries on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where am I now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You're in the north east. Can't you tell by our sophistication?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin couldn't tell. They looked like any other trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright, fine,&#8221; Bertha said. &#8220;But, you're going to have to believe us. We're very, very sophisticated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you help me leave the forest?&#8221; Benjamin asked the towering natural wonders around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends on where you'd like to go,&#8221; Earl said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I've got this map and it says I've got to find a waterfall on the side of the forest opposite the side I entered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Bertha. &#8220;Did you get that map from Myrna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Earl said slowly. &#8220;Myrna's maps are always outdated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Outdated? How often does a waterfall change?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well look what we have here, Earl,&#8221; Bertha said as a tree shook back and forth. &#8220;We've got a regular ole expert on waterfalls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin blushed lightly. He had never heard of a waterfall that changed directions or moved or relocated. But then again, he never heard of talking trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm just thinking that I've got this map and that's the only way I know how to get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; asked Bertha.</p>

<p>&#8220;New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trees shook violently back and forth and then didn't say a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyways,&#8221; Benjamin said as he sighed in frustration. &#8220;Can you help me find the exit to the forest that's opposite the desert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You came through the desert?&#8221; Gertrude asked. &#8220;No one survives the desert. That's one of the most dangerous places outside of all the castles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin felt a little proud of himself because he did, indeed, survive. It wasn't so bad, he thought. He could do it again if he needed to.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you need to exit opposite the desert, you're going to need to head for the canyon. The canyon will take you to a river and then Myrna's map may be able to guide you the rest of the way,&#8221; Earl said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great,&#8221; Benjamin said and then paused for a moment. &#8220;But, which way is the canyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm pointing to it,&#8221; Earl said.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked up at the nearest tree and saw a trunk soaring into the sky with hundreds of branches pointing every possible direction. He was a little embarrassed because he did not know what Earl meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm sorry but I can't--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can't you see, Benjamin?&#8221; Bertha asked with somewhat concern. &#8220;Earl is pointing in the direction of the canyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's right there, Benjamin,&#8221; Earl said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see but it's just that there's so many--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can't see,&#8221; Gertrude said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see,&#8221; Benjamin responded. &#8220;But your branches are going in so--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; Earl said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right there!&#8221; Bertha echoed.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked into the sky and decided he could only know which direction to go if he started to walk. He took three steps forward in one direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Earl yelled.</p>

<p>Then, he stopped and took three steps to his left.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Bertha yelled.</p>

<p>Then, he stopped and took three steps backwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, almost but!&#8221; Earl yelled.</p>

<p>Before Earl or Bertha could say anything more, Benjamin turned a little bit to the right and started to walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's it!&#8221; Gertrude said. &#8220;I guess he can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So if I walk straight, I'll walk to the canyon?&#8221; Benjamin asked the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won't able to miss it,&#8221; Bertha said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you need directions in the future,&#8221; Earl continued. &#8220;Just ask someone. It's incredibly rude to smash red berries into our sides. Unless you see James. You can smash red berries in the side of James. He's the worst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; Bertha said. &#8220;James is the worst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst indeed,&#8221; Gertrude echoed.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Benjamin said as he started to walk forward. &#8220;Thanks for your help and sorry again about your tree trunks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah,&#8221; said Earl. &#8220;Get out of here you little punk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin placed one foot in front of the other and found a spot as far in the distance as he could see. He would walk as straight as he could because, he decided, he was not about to ask any more trees for help. And, understandably, he was not about to mark his path, either. </p>





















<h1 id="chapter19">Chapter 19: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Request</h1>

<p>By his own calculation, Benjamin had taken three thousand steps before he reached the edge of the forest. And as far as he could tell, these steps had been in the same direction as each other because he saw a canyon extend into the horizon. The sun was setting now that he left the forest and Benjamin decided it was as good a time as any to get some rest.</p>

<p>He found a tree that looked as comfortable as any to rest against and closed his eyes as the crisp warm air brushed against his clothes. They had been closed for only minutes when he heard a familiar sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;South! South!&#8221; the squirrel yelled as it ran by. &#8220;South! South!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin watched the little creature run by his side and out of sight, leaving a small dust trail in his path. With the disturbance having passed, Benjamin once again closed his eyes to relax in the sun. And just as he was settled, the voice appeared again.</p>

<p>&#8220;North! North!&#8221; the squirrel yelled as it ran by again. &#8220;North! North!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin jumped to his feet and took one step toward the squirrel who ran away faster. The little woodland creature was running back and forth. Only seconds later, Benjamin saw the squirrel turn around in the distance and begin running back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;South! South!&#8221; the squirrel yelled in the distance.</p>

<p>Realizing that his nap time had passed and that this squirrel was going to run back and forth indefinitely, Benjamin positioned himself directly in the path of the animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;South! South!&#8221; the squirrel screamed.</p>

<p>Benjamin shifted to his left and then to his right, making sure the squirrel was going to run straight at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;South! South!&#8221; the squirrel screamed as its eyes widened and slobber flew from its lips.</p>

<p>It was only twenty feet away when Benjamin stretched his arms as wide as they could reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;South! South!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin braced himself for a collision with a little animal weighing little more than an orange.</p>

<p>&#8220;SOUTH!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the squirrel neared, it did not slow. Benjamin crouched to the ground and lunged at the little guy. And although Benjamin thought he would quickly outmatch the tiny speed demon, it was going so fast that it hit Benjamin square in the stomach. The young boy and the adrenaline-filled squirrel rolled together over and over and over until both of them lay side by side with their arms stretched to their sides and their legs in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;South,&#8221; the squirrel said faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch,&#8221; said Benjamin.</p>

<p>Neither animal moved for a minute as they both pondered what just happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;My head hurts,&#8221; the squirrel whispered as it stood up and adjusted the goggles it had been wearing to keep dirt out of its eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ran right into me,&#8221; Benjamin said as he rubbed his belly. &#8220;Your head should hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't even see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was standing right in front of you the entire time. How didn't you see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I run with my eyes closed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You run with your eyes closed? How do you know where you're going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I yell the direction I want to go. If I want to go north, I yell north! If I want to go south, I yell south. East? East! West? West!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But yelling the direction isn't going to help when you run into something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I've been running around for forty years. I've learned a thing or two. First thing I learned is that yes, you do run into things. Second thing I learned is that I can run a lot faster if I run with my eyes closed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you running to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that's a better question than asking about the weather,&#8221; the squirrel said as it propped its elbow on its knee and tilted its head to the sky. It tapped the ground several times with its tail and then smacked its lips. &#8220;I supposed you can ask where are we all running? Or, are we running? Or, are we running to something or are we running from something.&#8221; The squirrel got to his feet and pressed its finger against its forehead. It stopped and shifted its head back quickly. &#8220;Or, we're running from and to something! But what does that mean while we're running? I suppose that would mean we're always running from something and we're always running to something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you were just running,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;What were <i>you</i> running from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bears?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. The bears. They're awful. Will eat you alive, really. Scary things. That's another reason I close my eyes: bears. If I can't see the bears, I won't be scared of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could avoid them if you saw them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The squirrel paced back and forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you're right. If I saw the bears, I could avoid them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are running away from bears?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I'm running away from a lot of issues,&#8221; the squirrel said as he nudged Benjamin's sneaker with its elbow. &#8220;But yes, mostly bears. And, my fear of failure but we don't need to talk about that. How did you get so smart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think I'm very smart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you certainly ask interesting questions. I've been running back and forth away from bears for forty years and no one has asked me these types of questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I'm curious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curiosity is a great thing!&#8221; the squirrel said quickly. &#8220;Don't ever lose that. Curiosity can get you very far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll remember that,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; the squirrel said as it wiped the dirt from its goggles. &#8220;You're actually smart and curious enough to help one of my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of help does he need?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see he collects nuts. Walnuts, to be precise. And, you see he's got this problem where he can't chew very well anymore. It's embarrassing and pretty gross and all. So he's got all these walnuts but he can't eat them because he can't get the shell open. Do you think you could help him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He needs someone to open the walnuts for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you see he can't do it himself. I don't know him very well but I'm sure he'd pay you back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin thought that this was going to distract him from his plan and although he wouldn't mind meeting another talking creature, he just couldn't. It would be a distraction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had time to help your friend, but I really must get going,&#8221; Benjamin said to the sad squirrel.</p>

<p>The squirrel lowered his head slowly and began twisting his left foot into the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; the squirrel said slowly. &#8220;I understand. It's OK, really. He can starve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't want him to starve,&#8221; Benjamin pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all animals have to eat, right? He should be fine eating... air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he's not going to be able to eat air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's OK,&#8221; the squirrel said as it waved its hand at Benjamin and began to take one step away. &#8220;You go wherever you need to go. Chesterfield will just have to develop a taste for eating dirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin felt bad. He knew that he could easily open walnuts and he didn't want this Chesterfield person to starve. He took one deep breath and wondered how much time it would take to crack a couple walnuts. If there were ten, it might take him less than ten minutes. He didn't know exactly but he was fine to take ten minutes to feed another animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;Where are these walnuts?&#8221;</p>

<p>The squirrel jumped in the air and shook Benjamin's hand with a new energy Benjamin had not yet see in the animal. And as soon as Benjamin realized that the squirrel had not yet let got of his hand, it ran as fast as it could, pulling Benjamin along behind it.</p>

<p>&#8220;North! North!&#8221; the squirrel yelled as it ran faster and faster. Benjamin's body was bouncing up and down on the grass, creating one of the biggest grass stains ever seen. &#8220;North! North!&#8221;</p>

<p>When they arrived at a large tree in the middle of a meadow, Benjamin looked behind him to see the path that his body had created by being dragged on the ground. It was exhausting and his body ached. The squirrel, however, had not lost his enthusiasm for Benjamin's willingness to help.</p>

<p>The squirrel ran to the trunk and knocked loudly. Benjamin heard another creature running around inside the massive tree. It was as tall as it was wide and had thousands of branches, each branch with thousands of leaves. It stood alone in a meadow a couple miles wide in every direction with mountains lining the edges. Wind brushed through wheat that had grown to Benjamin's waist as lonely cloud after lonely cloud took turns blocking the sun.</p>

<p>The squirrel knocked loudly on the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chesterfield!&#8221; the squirrel said. &#8220;I found a problem to all of our, I mean your problems! It's time to eat, Chesterfield!&#8221;</p>

<p>The running inside the tree came to an abrupt stop. The squirrel took a couple steps back from the trunk and a previously invisible door opened slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want, Barnaby?&#8221; an unknown figure shouted from within the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chesterfield, I've found our hero!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do with your bird?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It flew away,&#8221; Barnaby the squirrel said sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It flew away?&#8221; Chesterfield asked with disbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yup, it flew away,&#8221; Barnaby said while averting his eyes to Barnaby.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yup, flew away and all,&#8221; Barnaby said as he acted out the flying of a bird with his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave it to you as a present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you wanted me to keep it,&#8221; Barnaby protested. &#8220;Maybe you shouldn't hand out presents that are dead birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;I don't have much time. Can you give me whatever walnuts you have to open?&#8221;</p>

<p>The door to the tree trunk opened completely, a three foot by three foot door within the frame of a tree ten times that width. And standing within this relatively large door was a relatively small chipmunk named Chesterfield. He stood not four inches tall with one of the worst smiles Benjamin had seen on any living thing. If apples were smiles, Chesterfield's smile was a rotten apple smashed under truck and then scooped up with a shovel. It was difficult for Benjamin to look directly in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why that's wonderful!&#8221; Chesterfield exclaimed with his arms stretched to his sides. &#8220;Barnaby, you should have told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did tell you. This child is going to be our hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me get the walnuts!&#8221;</p>

<p>Chesterfield slammed the door closed and ran throughout the tree, shaking a branch and some leaves here and there. Benjamin heard the sounds of musical instruments, construction, and loud engines throughout the tree as Chesterfield moved about. It was the biggest house for a chipmunk Benjamin had ever seen. When the door swung open again minutes later, Chesterfield appeared with five walnuts in his mouth and hands. He scooted across the grass and placed them at Benjamin's feet.</p>

<p>Benjamin couldn't believe his luck. There were only five walnuts. This would take him no time at all. He would help a starving chipmunk and be on his way in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>He picked up the walnuts and examined each to see that they were ordinary walnuts that he had seen in his mother's kitchen many times. He knew how to open these shells because he had seen his parents open them many times before. All he had to do was find something hard to slam them against. And having learned his lesson in the forest, he wasn't about to slam the walnuts into the side of the tree. He strolled around the meadow and searched for a large rock, something the size of his head that would be sturdy enough with a flat surface to absorb a walnut.</p>

<p>He placed a rock between Barnaby and Chesterfield as they watched Benjamin's every move with increasing interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we go,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>Chesterfield put his hand against the rock. It looked like a man standing next to a huge boulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how long it took us to move that rock from here to where you just picked it up?&#8221; Chesterfield said with annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll put it back!&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>Chesterfield and Barnaby stood to the side. Benjamin picked up a walnut and slammed it against the rock, creating a quick cracking noise with a sudden burst of shell in the air. The squirrel and chipmunk covered their heads as it began to rain shell fragments.</p>

<p>Benjamin picked up the second. Crack!</p>

<p>The third. Crack!</p>

<p>The fourth. Crack!</p>

<p>And, the fifth. Crack!</p>

<p>He had opened all of the walnuts in less than five minutes. And, he felt really happy that he had done something that he had only seen his parents do. Now he knew he could do it as well.</p>

<p>The tiny little jaws of Chesterfield and Barnaby nearly touched the ground. They shook their heads and then applauded as an audience would applaud a golfer's drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was,&#8221; Chesterfield said, taking a slow step forward, &#8220;extremely impressive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; Benjamin said, happy to receive the compliment. &#8220;And, now you can eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Barnaby said, taking a quick step forward. &#8220;Now, he can eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, I should get going but I'm glad I was able to help you,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;Enjoy the walnuts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin grabbed his backpack and examined the long grass stain along his shirt. It would probably come out in the wash, he thought. They always did. As he started to walk away, Barnaby ran in front of Benjamin and put his hands out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Actually,&#8221; Barnaby said. &#8220;We didn't realize you would be so good at opening walnuts. Five walnuts is great. Don't get us wrong. We are very grateful for your help. But if we had a few more walnuts open, then Chesterfield could eat all month without having to find someone else to open them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnaby, I must be going. Why don't you try opening the walnuts?&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnaby held his fingers forward and Benjamin saw that they had all been worn out, presumably from opening many walnuts.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many more walnuts?&#8221; Benjamin asked. He couldn't stay long but he could open a couple more. And, it was a lot of fun smashed walnuts into a rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not many. As many as you want to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, bring out the walnuts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin returned to the rock and waited for Barnaby to stop whispering to Chesterfield so that he could begin opening the nuts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Actually,&#8221; Chesterfield said. &#8220;Would you mind coming inside my treehouse to open the rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inside the treehouse? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I thought I could offer you a spot of tea and some biscuits.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin only thought briefly about what biscuits and tea a chipmunk was capable of making.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am hungry,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin was also curious to see the inside of the tree. After he watched Chesterfield walk inside, he stuck his own head in to look inside. The space was as high as the tree and along the cylindrical room was a spiral staircase that spun around shelves and shelves of walnuts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on in!&#8221; Barnaby said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, come in,&#8221; Chesterfield said as he pulled out some biscuits and tea. Barnaby and Chesterfield looked at the size of the biscuits and then compared them to the size of Benjamin. They were not nearly as large as they should be to satisfy the child's appetite. &#8220;Come in! Come in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin squeezed through the tiny door until he was completely inside the tree. Barnaby shut the door and Chesterfield handed Benjamin biscuit after biscuit. As Benjamin ate the delicious treats, he began to wonder why there were so many walnuts on the shelves.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you really like walnuts?&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know if like is the right word, but we've gotten used to them,&#8221; Chesterfield said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like there are hundreds here,&#8221; Benjamin replied as he sipped tea and ate another biscuit. He had eaten nearly a dozen so far while Barnaby was halfway through his first biscuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Chesterfield said as he tapped his fingers together. &#8220;There are actually a few more than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A few more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not many more. Just a few. We were hoping you could help us open a few. You opened the five walnuts so quickly that it will take you such a short amount of time than it would take us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many is a few?&#8221; Benjamin asked with caution.</p>

<p>Barnaby and Chesterfield started to ascend the staircase backwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; Benjamin said as he noticed the chipmunk and squirrel walking up the staircase. &#8220;How many is a few?&#8221;</p>

<p>They kept walking faster and faster and faster until they were out of Benjamin's reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty-two million,&#8221; Barnaby said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty-two million walnuts!&#8221; Benjamin explained as he stood on his feet. &#8220;I am not going to open forty-two million walnuts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It'll take you such a short amount of time compared to how long it will take us!&#8221; Barnaby protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I'm not concerned with how long it would take you. It's going to take me longer than I offered you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we gave you biscuits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll open a dozen and then that's it,&#8221; Benjamin decided. He grabbed twelve walnuts from the shelf and then smashed them individually on the stone inside the tree. Twelve open walnuts appeared on the ground below and as before, Chesterfield and Barnaby stood on the staircase and golf clapped. &#8220;Now, I must be leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin gathered his backpack and went to open the door from which he entered. But, it was locked. He pushed on it as hard as he could but it would not open. There wasn't anything that would allow him to unlock the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; Benjamin yelled up the tree house. &#8220;The door is locked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Chesterfield said. &#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like you to open it for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think we can do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because we have a lot of walnuts that need to be opened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You open this door right now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you open all of the walnuts, we will open it immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin was irate. He shook the door violently which caused the tree to vibrate ever so slightly. Walnuts fell from the tallest of shelves. He grumbled and his voiced echoed throughout the tree. Barnaby and Chesterfield climbed higher and higher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once you open all the walnuts,&#8221; Chesterfield said. &#8220;We will unlock the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would take days, weeks, months, and maybe a year to open forty-two million walnuts. There was no chance he could do this within a reasonable amount of time. But Benjamin realized something else which was much more important to him. He had been tricked. He assumed he would only have to open a few more walnuts, not millions. And now that he was locked inside the tree trunk, he was being held prisoner by a chipmunk and a squirrel.</p>

<p>He decided not to open a single walnut.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not opening any!&#8221; Benjamin yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, fine,&#8221; Chesterfield said. &#8220;But if you don't any, then you'll probably starve unless you can eat air. You're going to have to open a few to satisfy yourself. Those biscuits will only last so long. If you need us, we'll be in the loft.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnaby and Chesterfield ran all the way up the staircase to the top of the tree to a loft that was away from Benjamin's sight. The staircase was too narrow and thin to support Benjamin's weight. It would break on the first step.</p>

<p>Benjamin needed to figure out how to leave. He couldn't open the door and he wasn't going to open all the walnuts.</p>

<p>He paced back and forth at the bottom of the tree trunk thinking about all the ways that one might be able to leave.</p>

<p>He could dig a tunnel. But, he did not have a shovel and the trunk was too tough for his hands.</p>

<p>He could punch a hole in the tree trunk. But, the tree trunk was more than a foot thick and he didn't have anything that strong.</p>

<p>He could explode the entire tree with dynamite. But, he didn't have any dynamite.</p>

<p>And then he settled upon a solution that was the least easy but the most promising. He would scale the inside of the tree like a rock climber scaling the side of a mountain. At the top, he would grab Barnaby and Chesterfield.</p>

<p>Benjamin put his backpack on and found the wall that he would like to scale. He had never climbed any wall or shelf and this one, unfortunately, was very, very high.</p>

<p>He sighed with frustration at being trapped in the tree. And as soon as he took a breath, he began his climb. Hand over hand and foot over foot he climbed and climbed. Walnuts feel everywhere as he shook the shelves and moved his feet and hands in different spots. It was difficult but Benjamin was beginning to get comfortable with what he was doing.</p>

<p>He was comfortable until he looked down.</p>

<p>He was twenty feet above the ground and realized that he had nothing to stop him from falling on the ground.</p>

<p>But, it was too late. He was nearly halfway to the top of the tree and he needed to continue. With each climb, he knocked walnuts to the ground. His left foot slipped off as he tried to find a sturdy location to place it, causing him to hold on as tightly as he could with just his hands. The walnuts falling to the ground sounded like a pitter patter of rain against wood. Benjamin regained his composure by finding a resting spot for his left leg. He kept looking above so that he knew where he was going to step next.</p>

<p>Eventually, he made it to the top. And at the top, he saw a loft with a squirrel and a chipmunk asleep in front of a massive television screen. They had been watching some Spanish soap opera show together. Benjamin couldn't believe that they were sleeping while forcing him to do all that work.</p>

<p>He squeezed into the loft and then slowly nudged his way behind them. When he decided that he was close enough and that they were still sleeping, he grabbed both of them at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Woah! No!&#8221; Barnaby yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of this! Stop it!&#8221; Chesterfield screamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was not very nice!&#8221; Benjamin yelled at Barnaby and Chesterfield outside the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;We're sorry! We're sorry!&#8221; Barnaby said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we're terribly sorry!&#8221; Chesterfield said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go! We'll set you free!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, unexpectedly, both of them burst into tears. The noises they made while crying were embarrassing. They cried and bawled and shook and screamed while Benjamin sat with Barnaby in his left hand and Chesterfield in his right. It was an uncomfortable situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We're sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We know we're awful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't kill us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take all the walnuts you want. Have them all,&#8221; Barnaby said in tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you can have them all. Whatever you want. We're really sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't want any walnuts. I just want to leave,&#8221; Benjamin said without letting go of either animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, fine, we'll let you go. Don't kill us! Please don't kill us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not going to kill you!&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're not?&#8221; Barnaby asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, why would you think I'm going to kill you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because that's what Aloysius promises to do whenever he grabs us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aloysius Trenhaile?&#8221; Benjamin asked with curiosity. &#8220;How do you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little boy,&#8221; Chesterfield said. &#8220;Why do you think we have forty-two million walnuts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you don't starve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that's not exactly it,&#8221; said Barnaby. &#8220;I may have lied a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You both lied a lot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; Barnaby said. &#8220;We lied a lot. We send walnuts to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle for food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You send him food? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that he doesn't kill us,&#8221; Chesterfield said. &#8220;We put all of the cracked walnuts in that basket on the branch over there.&#8221; Chesterfield pointed to a basket on the opposite wall from the loft. &#8220;Every week, a bird comes and picks it up to take it to Aloysius Trenhaile. And in exchange, we get to live another week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn't sound like a great way to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; Barnaby said. &#8220;That's why we've been trying to find someone else to open up all these walnuts. So, we don't have to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn't make what you did to me right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We know!&#8221; Barnaby and Chesterfield yelled together.</p>

<p>And for the second time, they cried and bawled and shook and screamed as Benjamin's grip on the both of them remained tight.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at all of the walnuts and then looked at the basket. That basket was headed for Aloysius Trenhaile's castle and that was where Benjamin was.</p>

<p>&#8220;When does the bird come next?&#8221; Benjamin asked the two of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon,&#8221; Chesterfield said. &#8220;That basket is ready to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;I'm going to hide underneath the walnuts in that basket and have that bird take me to that castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could do that if you want, or we could just open the door for you to leave,&#8221; Barnaby offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to go to Aloysius Trenhaile's Castle and that bird will be able to take me there.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Chesterfield said. &#8220;We can hide you in the basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After the end of the movie?&#8221; Barnaby asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Benjamin said as he tightened his grip on the two animals.</p>

<p>Benjamin sat with a fist clenched around a chipmunk and a squirrel until the Spanish romance had concluded. Then, he slipped across to the other side of the tree and tunnelled his way through the walnuts to get to the bottom.</p>

<p>&#8220;We're really sorry again,&#8221; Chesterfield said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's OK, but don't do it to anyone else,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won't!&#8221; Barnaby said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, I'm sorry you have to work for Aloysius,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;I hear bad things about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be very careful,&#8221; Chesterfield said. &#8220;Aloysius Trenhaile is the most dangerous creature alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chesterfield and Barnaby then covered the basket with a blanket as Benjamin waited for the bird to arrive. </p>

















<h1 id="chapter20">Chapter 20: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Bird</h1>

<p>Benjamin waited five minutes at the bottom of the basket before he felt it jostle back and forth. He wasn't sure if it was Chesterfield and Barnaby so he started to push walnut after walnut away from his face. He did not want to startle whatever was making such loud thumping noises so he carefully peeled away a corner of the blanket that covered the basket. On the other side, Benjamin saw the ugliest, biggest, most vile goose he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Before the goose could see him, Benjamin threw back the blanket and covered himself with walnuts again. The bird was nearly ten times larger than Benjamin, which explained why the basket was so large. It was also ten times more disgusting. It smelled like sewage and it kept burping all over the basket.</p>

<p>This animal was far from graceful. And if its hygiene was related to its flying abilities, Benjamin feared for his safety. He wondered if this was a good idea. Surely, this was only one way to get to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle. This didn't have to be the way. He could go by land. It would certainly be safer than by air with this awful beast. It didn't even have all of its feathers. And, some of the feathers that did remain were painted odd colors like orange and blue. They were certainly not feathers one would find on a goose.</p>

<p>Benjamin wanted to leave.</p>

<p>He moved the walnuts from his face and began to make his escape. The goose kept nudging the basket back and forth while making a loud chirping noise that ended in loud coughing. It had some sort of respiratory problem. As Benjamin peeled back the blanket, he started to climb from the basket while the goose looked the other direction. He pulled his weight as quickly as he could and lifted one leg over the basket. And as soon as he was about to lift the other leg over the basket, the goose began to flap its wings as strongly as it could. It created a vortex of stinky, awful wind that pushed Benjamin right back into the basket. The wind swirled around as a tornado would. Dust and dirt and awful smells blew about. Benjamin used all of his strength to get back to his feet and to step into the gusts pushing him back. He reached the ledge of the basket. And as soon as he jumped in the air to clear the basket and return to the ground, the goose grabbed the handle and lifted the basket into the sky.</p>

<p>It went higher and Benjamin could see the top of the treehouse.</p>

<p>It went even higher and Benjamin could see the expansive meadow.</p>

<p>It went even higher still and Benjamin could see all the mountains that surrounded the meadow.</p>

<p>And when it went so high that Benjamin could see the large forest from which he came, he knew he had no choice but to sit and enjoy the ride. Leaving the basket now would certainly mean death. He would have to endure the flight, as smelly and stinky as it was.</p>

<p>Benjamin had never been this high above the ground in his life. He watched with amazement as a river carved its way between rolling green hills into a mountain range capped with white tops. A volcano in the distanced puffed smoke into the air next to a lake which glistened under the beaming sun. He could see meadows stretch for distances he could not imagine walking and canyons that he could not imagine traversing. The land extended in all directions and it became apparent that this land was not small.</p>

<p>Nor, was it empty.</p>

<p>Benjamin could see Castle Ehtahl, from which he recently left. And in the opposite direction, he could see nearly a dozen other castles of various shapes and designs. The only characteristic that they appeared to have in common was that all of the castles had very high walls.</p>

<p>Except one.</p>

<p>One castle in the far distance had very low walls. Unlike all of the others, however, it had fire on the ground as well as fire throughout the buildings. There was dark, black smoke billowing throughout and an occasional ball of flame shot into the air. It looked uninviting and deeply disturbing.</p>

<p>And, that was exactly where this ugly goose was headed.</p>

<p>Benjamin knew it must be the castle because it alone looked like a nightmare. It was the worst, most awful place Benjamin had ever seen or imagined in his life. It was both scary and terrifying. And, Benjamin did not want to go there. He looked to the ground and guessed that he was several thousand feet above the ground. The chances of him landing safely or alive were slim. He needed to get this goose to fly lower.</p>

<p>Without creating too much of a plan, Benjamin grabbed a walnut and threw it at the goose. The filthy bird screamed in annoyance and shook the basket from side to side. This was not what Benjamin wanted. He needed another plan.</p>

<p>As Benjamin thought hard, the goose shook the basket from side to side again. And then, it did it again. With each subsequent shaking, the goose moved the basket more and more violently.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked ahead and noticed that objects were being fired passed the goose at an amazing speeds. One flew by and then another. And then, another. He looked in the direction from which they were coming and was able to see a group of people in a meadow.</p>

<p>They were trying to shoot down the goose.</p>

<p>The bird swung its wings left and nearly escaped getting hit. Then, it banked to the right and avoided several more shots being fired directly at it. Benjamin held onto the basket as tightly as he could, fearful that either the goose was going to drop him or that the bird would be hit.</p>

<p>The goose jerked to the right suddenly and several walnuts flew from the basket to the ground below. Benjamin gripped the side as tightly as he could. The goose began to spiral to avoid the shots being fired at it.</p>

<p>And then, it was hit.</p>

<p>Something hit the goose square in the head. The bird, the basket, and the boy were in freefall headed straight for land. Feathers flew everywhere and the goose screamed in panic. Benjamin screamed too. He was crashing into the earth and this was not an enjoyable adventure.</p>

<p>The air moved so fast that Benjamin could not tell how close he was to land. And since there was no sign of slowing down, he decided the best thing for him to do was close his eyes. He did not want to see what was going to happen next.</p>

<p>He braced for impact.</p>

<p>The goose braced for impact.</p>

<p>And the basket splintered into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>Benjamin bounced into the air with a thousand walnuts around him.</p>

<p>And when he landed, he skidded along a dirt path and fell neatly along a feathery pillow. The feathery pillow was, of course, the goose which broke Benjamin's fall. After a few seconds, it knocked Benjamin away and investigated the mess of the situation. The basket was destroyed and walnuts were everywhere. And to the birds' surprise, it had been hauling a person along too.</p>

<p>It stretched its broken feathers as wide as it could and screeched at Benjamin as loudly as it could. Benjamin, however, was dazed from the fall and simply sat while the bird yelled and screamed at him. He could have cared less. He did not know how he survived such a landing.</p>

<p>Before he could react to the goose, the bird gathered some walnuts in its mouth and fled. It flew above the canyon nearby and eventually, beyond Benjamin's sight. Benjamin hoped to never see that animal again. Or, at the very least, to never smell it again.</p>

<p>Benjamin would have continued to sit in a daze for a little longer but he heard footsteps and yelling from the other side of the hill that he had landed upon. He ran for his backpack, grabbed it, and then hid behind a boulder five times his size.</p>

<p>The footsteps were louder and closer. Benjamin didn't know how many people were running toward him but he guessed it was a dozen. He stayed as still as he could with his back to the boulder. And then, he saw a shadow cast beyond him. And then, another. And, another. There were more than a dozen people together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where'd it go?&#8221; said a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must've flown away,&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>&#8220;It dropped the basket,&#8221; said another. &#8220;So, I guess we're good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright, let's take the basket and get back to camp,&#8221; said the first voice.</p>

<p>Benjamin couldn't see the people but he heard them gather the basket and pick up the walnuts. The shadows moved quickly and Benjamin's curiosity grew. He leaned against the boulder and slowly started to move to its edge. He peeked around the side and saw lots of people dressed completely in blue.</p>

<p>And among all the people dressed in blue, one stopped moving and stared straight at Benjamin. Benjamin froze. Dozens of people in blue moved frantically around the one person who stayed completely still.</p>

<p>Benjamin ran.</p>

<p>He ran as fast as he could through cacti and rocks.</p>

<p>And as he ran, he heard footsteps chasing after him.</p>

<p>He weaved every which way he could and heard the footsteps fading in the distance. He paused for a moment to look behind. There were only rocks and cacti everywhere. He sat down to catch his breath, his heart still racing.</p>

<p>He didn't know who those people were or why they were after the basket. There was a hill not too far away and Benjamin thought about climbing it in order to see if he could watch the people. He wondered where they were going.</p>

<p>But as he continued to catch his breathe, he felt two hands on his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't move,&#8221; said the voice. &#8220;Don't move a muscle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin didn't move. He didn't have a plan to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't move and do exactly as I say,&#8221; the voice continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK. OK,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly. &#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't move!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you shoot down the goose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, I'm the one that hit it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin recognized the voice and spun around to see Selma Applebaum standing before him. She wore a small blue outfit and had her arms crossed over her body. Her head shook side to side as she wore an expression of disbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, we didn't know you would be inside the basket,&#8221; Selma Applebaum said. &#8220;What, Benjamin Buckingham, were you doing inside it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked angry and Benjamin was worried she still had whatever it was that knocked down the huge bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm trying to leave,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're obviously not doing very well,&#8221; Selma said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course not. I'm still here aren't I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were going to leave by goose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just along for the ride. It was going to take me to where I could get a key to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you have any idea where you were headed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you. I was going to get the key so that I could leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm so confused by you, Benjamin. How do you know where the key is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Benjamin said as he rushed to grab his backpack. He unfolded his dirty map and showed it to Selma. &#8220;Here. I got this map that shows me where it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma examined the map and scratched her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn't a very good map,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So where were you trying to go? That goose was headed for an awful place. Were you trying to go there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was headed to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle. That's where the goose was headed,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>Selma looked confused and Benjamin wasn't sure why she was becoming more frustrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; Selma said as she rushed him behind a boulder a little further away. &#8220;They're going to realize I left so I have to return soon. Listen, you can't go to Aloysius Trenaile's castle by way of a goose. If you arrive in a basket full of walnuts, you'll be killed. You're lucky I was able to shoot down that bird. I saved your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, you also almost killed me in the process!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The way I look at it is that you were doomed either way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing out here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I snuck out. I wanted to help destroy the nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Destroy the nightmares? How does shooting a goose destroy nightmares?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, I'm surprised you're still alive,&#8221; Selma said as she strained her neck to see if the others were still around. &#8220;The birds deliver food to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle. We shoot down the birds to stop the food deliveries. Without food, they starve and can't make nightmares. If you go to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle by bird, you're going to get shot down again. At least, that's our goal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, how do I get to the castle? I need King Bernard Zwirn to give me his key.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma paused as they listened to the footsteps of the others beginning to leave. She grabbed Benjamin by the shoulders and stared straight into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet me tomorrow outside Castle Ehtsetra,&#8221; she said quickly.</p>  </p>

<p>&#8220;Where is that?&#8221;</p>  </p>

<p>Selma grabbed Benjamin's map and scribbled a path through it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're here right now on the map and this is where I'll meet you. See you tomorrow,&#8221; she said as she sprinted back to her group.</p>  </p>

<p>&#8220;But why--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow!&#8221; Selma yelled.</p>






















<h1 id="chapter21">Chapter 21: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Glass Castle</h1>

<p>Benjamin waited at the front of the gate for Selma to appear. He spent the night traversing a river, climbing the side of a cliff, hiking through fields of tangled weeds, and sleeping in a cave. He was bruised and cut and very, very sleepy. And as he waited, he wondered how long he could continue like this. It appeared to him that his exit was further and further away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened to you?&#8221; Selma asked as she approached Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? I've been living outside for the past few days. This is what you get after you've been living outside for a while,&#8221; Benjamin responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should at least have taken a shower?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; Benjamin held his arms out to present the wild environment around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your map?&#8221; Selma asked. &#8220;There are public restrooms everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In my backpack,&#8221; Benjamin's jaw hung low. He had no idea there might be public restrooms here.</p>

<p>Before Benjamin had a chance to retrieve the map for Selma, she snatched the backpack away and rummaged through it. She took out a small notebook, which she thought contained the map. But when she looked at the cover, she realized it was something completely different.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; Selma asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's nothing,&#8221; Benjamin said as he took the backpack and extracted the map. &#8220;Here's what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, this is much more interesting. Is this a book of your dreams?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it's nothing. Take the map.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma scurried away with the notebook as Benjamin chased quickly after her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Selma said as she paged through it. &#8220;It's a list of your nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma stopped suddenly and turned to face Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn't a book of your dreams,&#8221; she said with surprise. &#8220;This is a book of nightmares. This book is full of nightmares. Why have you had so many nightmares?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin stopped and took the book away from Selma. He shoved it into his backpack and walked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, don't leave so quickly,&#8221; Selma said as she chased after him. &#8220;Why do you have so many nightmares? There are more nightmares in that book than I knew existed. I mean I knew there was a nightmare problem but you've got a really bad nightmare problem. Why do you have so many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know. Wouldn't you know better than I would?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don't think I would. I've always been told that nightmares target people who are susceptible to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means there's something in your life that makes you likely to have nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's what I'm asking you. What's so awful about your life that you've got all these nightmares?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My life's good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You eat well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you exercise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you get enough sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you're healthy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get sick once in awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not all the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you've got a bunch of friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, are we going to go inside the castle or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, we'll go in the castle but why didn't you answer my question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you're being really annoying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not like it's a complicated question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma paused and watched Benjamin march away quickly. She followed him at a speedy trot.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;Why don't you have friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do have friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rodney Cohen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Snark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you have any friends your own age?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who needs friends? It's not necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone needs friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, that might be why you have so many nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it. It must be something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't like people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like people just fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don't you have friends? It seems to me like you should have at least a couple friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Selma said. &#8220;I'll stop. But, I don't understand why you don't have friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because people don't like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don't like you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they don't like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know. If I knew, I'd change it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you can't change it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe there's something about you that other people just don't like. Maybe it's something you can't change.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then I won't ever have friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably not,&#8221; Selma said. &#8220;Unless, you make friends with people who like you for who you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We've been talking about this for too long. I want to go in the castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma shrugged her shoulders and let out a loud sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, let's go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma and Benjamin approached a large glass drawbridge that was much thicker and taller than the one at Castle Ehtahl. The drawbridge connected the castle over a moat filled with chipped red stone that followed the walls wherever they went. The walls, too, were a blue glass that offered a slight view into what was hidden behind. And everything behind was made of glass as well, glass of varying colors. A figure moved back and forth on the other side of the drawbridge, pacing like a guard would but moving quickly like someone in a panic.</p>

<p>On Benjamin's side of the moat, he saw a large blue button that he assumed might be a doorbell. He moved his hand to press it because that's what he does whenever he sees a button. But then, Selma grabbed his hand and gave him an unsatisfied look.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a certain way that you push the doorbell,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Each different way you push the doorbell tells the guard on the other side where you come from. And if you don't push the doorbell in any kind of recognizable way, he'll assume you're a nightmare or some other evil thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you push the doorbell?&#8221; Benjamin asked curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we are going to act as delivery people,&#8221; Selma said as she pointed to the boxes that she brought with her. &#8220;So, it'll be tap, tap, long, tap, long, tap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So these are secret passwords?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not really,&#8221; Selma said as she approached the doorbell. &#8220;It's just that the evil can't be bothered to slow down and think about anything for a little bit. They know the patterns. Evil is just always in a hurry for whatever reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin watched Selma tap the button, tap it again, press it for a long time, and then tap, long, and tap. The guard slightly visible through the glass stopped marching back and forth and appeared to put his hands on the glass drawbridge to try to see who was on the other side. A muffled sound appeared from around the blue button that seemed unintelligible at first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; said a man, presumably the guard from the other side.</p>

<p>Without pausing for a moment, Selma answered the voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delivery!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delivery? There are no deliveries on Saturdays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a special delivery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you delivering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are delivering boxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have plenty of boxes, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boxes filled with travel brochures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Travel brochures? But, why would anyone want to leave Castle Ehtsetra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were requested to be printed by the local travel agency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they asked for a Saturday delivery? This is quite peculiar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We're a few days late. It should have been Thursday but we had to print a few more copies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many copies do you have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thousands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thousands! Thousands of people want to travel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but thousands of people are interested in travelling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have fiction books to satisfy those only interested in travelling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But these brochures are going to help inspire the writers of those books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I've tried writing a book once and and it's an awful affair. Really, it's a lonely struggle. I don't know how one does it. If your brochures are going to help more books be written, I suppose that's a good thing. Take a few steps back and I'll lower the drawbridge. It's made of glass so be mindful of any sharp edges.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drawbridge jolted forward and then slowly began leaning forward as smoothly and gracefully as a massive sheet of glass could move. It glimmered in the sun and reflected different colors of blue in all directions. When the glass bridge finally stopped, Benjamin had his first glance behind the castle walls. And everything that he saw was made of glass. There were glass roads and glass trees and glass chairs and glass cars. There were glass trains and glass skyscrapers and glass clothing worn by otherwise normal looking people. It was nearly ten times as populous as Castle Ehtahl and everyone wore sunglasses, because among all of the glass were reflecting the sun. One skyscraper in particular appeared to soar so high into the blue sky so as to touch the sun in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's where we're headed,&#8221; Selma said as she watched Benjamin's eyes look higher and higher.</p>

<p>As they walked across the bridge, the guard greeted them on the other side. He was nearly four times taller than he was wide, a peculiar difference from the guards at Castle Ehtahl. His white clothing took on different colors as he moved among the different colors of glass. Unlike Castle Ehtahl, he seemed quite professional and quite capable of being a guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're much smaller than I expected you to be,&#8221; the guard said to Selma and Benjamin as they stood inside the castle walls. &#8220;How old are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We're eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight! Our eight year olds are nearly twice the size of you. Where are you from? Castle Eehjee? Castle Ayee? Castle Ihbihd? Castle Ahem? Castle Peehem?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin didn't realize there were so many castles to come from. He thought it was like the number of cities to come from at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Castle Ehtahl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was my next guess! That makes sense. You're a bit shorter over there. Anyways, do you know where the travel agency is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; Selma said quickly. &#8220;We've made lots of deliveries before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It really troubles me that so many people in the castle would be wanting to travel. We have everything we need in Castle Ehtsetra. Why would anyone want to leave?&#8221; the guard responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Selma said. &#8220;Maybe they want to see what exists somewhere else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's a bunch of rubbish in my mind. If they want to see what exists somewhere else, they should just read books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe they could read books and travel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not sure I like that. I think people should stay put. They should either be on one side of the wall or on the other side of the wall. I've been a guard for fifty years and let me tell you, it's very hard to sit on a wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, we're going to go,&#8221; Selma said as she started walking forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; the guard said. &#8220;But, don't stay too long. You're allowed to stay overnight but then you have to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, we're not going to be long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma and Benjamin walked among the hundreds of people moving to and fro in the middle of the glass city. They all had expressionless faces, their eyes hidden by dark sunglasses. Many people carried glass briefcases and just about everyone was wearing white clothing except for the occasional person who wore a blue color as blue as the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really come here often?&#8221; Benjamin asked Selma.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said quickly as she scanned the scene. &#8220;I've only been here once before when I was little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, how do you know where we're supposed to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I've got a good memory,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Nothing much changes in Castle Ehtsetra. The glass doesn't break as often as you'd think it would. We have to go up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma pointed to the top of the tall skyscraper Benjamin saw on the outside. It reached so far into the sky that it looked as if it might at one point leave the atmosphere.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's where we find a way to get you back to your home, without having to go to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked to an elevated tram station and joined the lines of people waiting for the next train. When it arrived, it was made of nothing but bright green glass that slid across an orange railway. They rode the train for a half an hour, moving throughout the city and stopping at various elevated train stations along the way. The glass structures allowed Benjamin to see into buildings in a way he could not have imagined when the walls were made of steel or brick. It allowed him to see people on different levels, interacting with their surroundings as if they were walking on air. The various colors of glass created different colors when seen through each other. And for all of the transparency throughout the buildings and structures and benches and greenery, the people were as quiet and still as possible. No one uttered a word to anyone else and no one seemed capable of a smile. They all looked like cloned models of each other, walking around a pristine glass environment.</p>

<p>&#8220;How--&#8221; Benjamin began to ask but stopped. As soon as he opened his mouth, he saw every face in the train turn in his direction. He did not utter a word further but his first word continued to echo over and over. Selma looked at him and put her finger to her lips.</p>

<p>Benjamin and Selma exited at the station that led them to the skyscraper at the center of the town. They encountered hundreds of other people before entering the building. Once inside, Benjamin felt more comfortable speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one says anything here,&#8221; he said to Selma. &#8220;How do people communicate if they cannot speak to one another?&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear that echo when you said one word?&#8221; she responded. &#8220;Imagine if everyone were to talk at once. Our ears would explode with the noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So no one talks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do. I've seen them. But, they're very careful with what they say because sounds bounce off the glass loudly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems like a difficult way to live,&#8221; Benjamin whispered to Selma as they walked to the front desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or it's as difficult as living in a place where everyone can say whatever they want but no one hears it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that's the same thing,&#8221; Benjamin said as he looked upwards and wondered how many floors he could see through from the ground.</p>

<p>At the front desk, a woman wearing white with large, bushy red hair moved her head from side to side in a jerky motion. Benjamin wondered how she did not hurt her neck because he knew he could not do so without hurting himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, may I help you?&#8221; the lady asked with a gentle, bouncy tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Selma responded. &#8220;What floor is the travel agency on?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she asked for the travel agency, everyone on the floor around them stopped and looked in her direction. The lady at the front desk stopped moving her head from side to side and stared at Selma with a surprised expression. Benjamin could hear his heartbeat among the silence of everything around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; the lady asked as she signaled to everyone else in the lobby to carry along. &#8220;Why do you want to go to the travel agency?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have these boxes to deliver,&#8221; Selma said as she pointed to the boxes that Benjamin was carrying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; the lady responded. &#8220;That's great! I thought for a second that you wanted to leave!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady laughed with a sound Benjamin thought was much louder than the woman was capable of making. She heaved her head back and forth as she pounded her fist into the table. Others in the lobby began to laugh and Benjamin heard what it was for everyone in a glass room to make a loud noise at once. It was both deafening and painful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Please! You must deliver those boxes at once. After all, they are not made of glass. It's a dreadful thing to have boxes made of cardboard. We have some of the finest boxes ever created and they are made of glass. When you deliver the boxes, please make sure the containers are disposed of. We cannot have those here. They must be destroyed. And if you children would like to change into white clothing, that could be arranged as--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We're only delivering the boxes and then we plan to leave,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; the lady answered. &#8220;I suppose you had better be on your way. It's floor two thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight on your right. And again, do not leave those boxes anywhere. They're quite out of place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin felt out of place. He did not know how people could live in an environment that had such strict rules around noise and materials. At home, no one cared what materials made a box. A box was a box. But here, everything had to be glass.</p>

<p>When they stepped into the glass elevator, Benjamin noticed that the two-thousand seven-hundred and eighty-eighth floor was the highest floor. With the thousands of buttons on the wall indicating each floor, Benjamin was glad this one was so easy to locate. They were alone in a tiny glass room being flung to the top of the skyscraper at a speed faster than Benjamin had experienced. And as they soared higher and higher, Benjamin's fear of heights became more and more real.</p>

<p>To distract himself, he turned to Selma.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do people do here?&#8221; he asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? They live,&#8221; she responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I mean they make dreams in Castle Ehtahl. What do they make here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said with an understanding look. &#8220;Daydreams.&#8221;</p>

















<h1 id="chapter22">Chapter 22: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Glass Tower</h1>

<p>They were nearly three hundred floors in the air when Benjamin's curiosity for searching for the dream studios caught the best of him. He looked down. And upon looking down, he wished he hadn't done so because his fear of heights became even more real. It was one thing to stand on the roof of his building in New York. It was another thing to be soaring into the air in a glass container, approaching clouds at a blistering fast speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been on this elevator before?&#8221; he asked Selma nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, why?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm just wondering if it ever breaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Breaks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, like does it ever get stuck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Selma responded as she looked around the glass cube. &#8220;I doubt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Benjamin said while taking a deep breath. &#8220;That makes me feel a lot better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It probably crashes to the ground first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Into thousands of pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don't have to worry--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, tell me the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There's no way you could survive a fall from up here,&#8221; Selma said with a chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn't making me feel good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There probably hasn't been an accident on this elevator all week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All week? What about last week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tons of accidents!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Selma said as she stopped laughing. &#8220;Just think of something happy. You are in a castle that makes daydreams by the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin closed his eyes and tried to imagine he was not thousands of feet in the air. He thought about what he would be doing if he were at home at that very moment. Walking home from school, he thought. It was a sunny day and the roads were covered with cars and taxis in New York. A bus a few blocks away picked up some pedestrians while a fire truck passed in the opposite direction. A few birds flew overhead, moving from tree to tree in search of some shade to cool from the heat. A bakery on the other side of the street had an unusually long line for an afternoon while its next door Nordic restaurant was unusually empty. As Benjamin walked further and further, he noticed the people on the street were not talking to one another. No one was talking in the bakery or the restaurant or on the bus for that matter. They were all wearing sunglasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up!&#8221; Selma yelled as she grabbed Benjamin's shoulder.</p>

<p>Benjamin opened his eyes and thought he heard thunder and saw lightning in the distance. Selma looked like she had been trying to wake him for a while. She let out a loud sigh and then released his shoulder abruptly before moving to the other side of the elevator.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was daydreaming,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You've got to figure out how to stop the nightmares,&#8221; she said without looking at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't have any control of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do, that's what I've been told. You've got to figure out how to make the nightmares stop. Or else, bad things will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of bad things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Things worse than falling thousands of feet down an elevator shaft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know. That's pretty terrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. This will be worse. When there are more nightmares, there are fewer dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elevator stopped and Benjamin felt his stomach touch his shoulders. A bell chimed loudly and the doors slowly parted to reveal a small hallway on the two-thousand seven-hundred and eighty-eighth floor. Benjamin and Selma stepped from the elevator into a room shaped like a glass ball that felt like a snow globe. He could see nothing but blue skies, clouds, and the sun. There were no birds flying around at this height. Benjamin and Selma were the only living things around.</p>

<p>Except for a man wearing a bright white suit standing at attention in front of the only door in the room. He held a gold cane and wore a white top hat slightly tilted to the side. Benjamin thought the man looked more like a cartoon character than a real person.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I help you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; Selma said as she stepped forward. &#8220;My friend and I would like to speak with the travel agent. We'd like to go on a trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I'm terribly sorry but the travel agent isn't here right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Selma said with disappointment. &#8220;When will she return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When she feels like it I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what time that would be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we wait until she arrives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm generally not allowed to let people wait. You could come back tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can't come back tomorrow because we have to leave today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite a predicament. I suppose you could stay on one condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What's the condition?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>The man twisted his cane around his hand and pointed to a lightbulb at the top of the glass spherical roof. Benjamin and Selma looked in the direction to which he was pointing. And upon seeing what the man was pointing to, Benjamin felt his stomach turn in disapproval.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a piece of dust on the outside of the glass. I have a harness and everything but I've just not had the time to clean it. It's so busy here,&#8221; said the man.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked around and imagined that no one had been to this floor in quite some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can remove that bit of dust, I suppose you can stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright, he'll do it,&#8221; Selma said before asking Benjamin whether he would be willing to do the task.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really think we need to talk about this,&#8221; Benjamin said while stepping backwards in disapproval. &#8220;Do you have a hose? Maybe we could hose the outside of the glass. You don't need someone to go outside. Or maybe the wind will blow it away? Have you tried tapping on the glass for a while to knock it loose?</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me young child, I have tried nothing. But, I am sure the only guaranteed way of removing the piece of dust for good is to go outside and get it. Otherwise, it could just go somewhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma looked at Benjamin with an expression that felt like she was already preparing the harness. Benjamin looked at Selma with an expression that was purely disapproval with her decision. But if he wanted to go home, he decided he would do it. He didn't come this way for nothing. At this point in his adventure, he learned to just do things.</p>

<p>He let out a long sigh and Selma ran to get the harness. She strapped Benjamin in place and Benjamin shook his head slowly with disbelief. He did not want to go outside. Not here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a helmet?&#8221; he asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there's a helmet!&#8221; Selma yelled with enthusiasm as she thumped the helmet on his head. &#8220;Look at you! You're an explorer ready to clean some windows!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at himself and wondered how he had gotten himself into such a mess. Selma nearly pushed him to a glass window from where Benjamin could step outside onto the spherical glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll hold onto the rope and as soon as you want to come back inside, just give it a good tug,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The rope was attached to the top of the room by a pulley with one end connected to Benjamin and the other end connected to a wheel that looked like it belonged on an ocean ship. Selma used all of her weight to turn the wheel, giving Benjamin more rope with which he could step outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really think--&#8221; he started to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Off you go!&#8221; Selma yelled with excited enthusiasm as she gave the wheel a full turn. Benjamin nearly fell outside the window with the sudden slack in the rope.</p>

<p>The man in white stood without making a sound, adjusting his hat and cane every so often. His eyes focused on the small piece of dust that Benjamin was going to retrieve.</p>

<p>Benjamin, for his part, couldn't even see the dust from the window. It was so small he had no idea where it was. But as he leaned outside the window, he decided he would move in the general direction of the dust. Benjamin's thoughts were as cloudy as the skyline in the distance. He couldn't make any sense of what he was about to do. He also could not understand how Selma could have such a wide smile as she was currently wearing. With one more glance of disbelief, he turned and stepped onto the glass ceiling.</p>

<p>It was worse than he expected. Outside of the glass skyscraper, it was windy, cold, scary, frightening, terrifying, excruciating, and traumatizing. Benjamin positioned his feet against the glass so he could walk down the side of the wall. As he started to walk down, he could see Selma and her big smile spinning the ship's wheel as fast as she could. As she spun and spun, the man pointed his cane lower and lower, indicating that Benjamin needed to walk further.</p>

<p>He never thought he'd be in this kind of situation and decided that he needed to find that piece of dust as fast as possible. This was worse than most of his nightmares.</p>

<p>As he stepped lower and lower, he came within eyesight of where the man was pointing. Selma kept spinning and spinning. And as he tried to get closer to the glass to find the one spec of dirt that had soiled this otherwise perfect, pristine skyscraper he slipped.</p>

<p>Selma stopped spinning.</p>

<p>The man in white jolted forward.</p>

<p>And Benjamin slammed into the side of the skyscraper.</p>

<p>If it wasn't painful, it was embarrassing. But with eyes now as close to the glass as they could be, he saw the spec of dust. He couldn't believe it. It was smaller than he expected and absolutely impossible for the average person to see. He picked it up and showed it to Selma and the man in white who eagerly nodded their heads up and down. Benjamin put it in his pocket and Selma spun the wheel the opposite direction as quickly as she could.</p>

<p>Walking back into the glass sphere was a lot easier than walking out. Benjamin felt that way about most places, that it was a lot easier returning than it was going. But in this case, he was thousands of feet above the ground tied to a rope that was being controlled by his inexplicably happy classmate on the other side.</p>

<p>So when he got back inside the room, he felt nothing but accomplishment for having found the piece of dust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I've got it!&#8221; he yelled as he removed his harness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were a goner,&#8221; Selma said with an expression that was much more worried than he had seen before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't believe it but I got it! Your castle is now clean of dirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin stepped forward and handed the spec of dust to the man in white. It looked like a tiny dot on his white gloves. The man removed his monocle and looked at it closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot believe it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean. Wow. Just wow. You really went out there and got this spec of dust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; Benjamin said proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean. That's just nuts. Wow. I can't believe you went out there. No one goes out there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one?&#8221; Benjamin was confused at how shocked the man was.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one! You've got to be insane to go out there! Everyone leaves. They all go back down the elevator and never come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They leave?&#8221; Benjamin was even more confused as to why he did what he just did.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean. That was impressive! I didn't think you'd be able to do it. Wow. You're a really nuts kid. You were outside the window! You were thousands of feet in the air. That's crazy, right? Crazy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin crossed his arms and noticed Selma did the same. They were not excited by the man's game that they had just played.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean I didn't have to go outside to get the piece of dust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn't expect you to! I thought the two of you would leave!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn't know you were playing a game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sorry about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So can we see the travel agent now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why of course! I mean, anyone that would go outside this room certainly needs a vacation. Anyone that comes up here just goes back down. They want to leave, especially if it means doing what you just did. You both need a vacation! You might be the first two to take a vacation since I've been here,&#8221; he said as he grabbed the doorknob behind him. &#8220;Here, go inside. The travel agent is inside. You can leave the boxes here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin and Selma walked inside, exchanging annoyed glances with each other and the crazy man dressed in white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oops,&#8221; Selma whispered to Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;Oops.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seated at a small desk in this room made of black glass, Benjamin saw a woman who looked exactly like a peacock. Her hair was every color and extended as wide as the room. It was as brilliant and perfect as all of the glass castle. And as she raised her tiny head, Benjamin saw one of the prettiest women he had ever seen. She tilted her head to the side and slowly moved her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why hello you two and welcome to Dream Travels LLC,&#8221; she said as elegantly as one could say such words. &#8220;And, where would you like to go today?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;New York.&#8221;</p>




















<h1 id="chapter23">Chapter 23: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Queen</h1>

<p>Castle Ehtsetra was silent. Benjamin knew that any people who had previously been stirring thousands of feet below had stopped. Nothing moved. Nothing made a sound. Except, that was, for the travel agent who tapped her pen on the nameplate on her desk. It read <i>Lizette Gohara, Travel Agent of Dream Excellence</i>. She tapped her named steadily. But, she ground her teeth with increasingly tense ferocity.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means he'd like to go to Castle Newer,&#8221; Selma said as she pushed Benjamin away.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's not what he said,&#8221; Lizette Gohara responded tersely. &#8220;He said he wanted to go to New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I misspoke,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly. &#8220;I meant Castle Newer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one misspeaks that eloquently,&#8221; Lizetta Gohara continued. &#8220;How do you know about this place, New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lizette Gohara stood from her desk, the hair on her head touching three walls of the room. She leaned forward on her desk and brought her face within inches of Benjamin's. Her eyes narrowed and Benjamin felt like she was trying to read his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;It was a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no mistakes,&#8221; Lizette Gohara said as she spaced out her words longer and longer. &#8220;There are only surprises. How do you know where New York is?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin did not know how to respond and so he looked to Selma for advice. But unfortunately, Lizette Gohara had her hand over Selma's mouth. She could not help him now. Benjamin had to answer for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, I want to go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lizette Gohara stood back as quickly as she had moved forward. Benjamin did not want to lie. He knew lying was wrong. And, he was going to the travel agency so that he could find a way back home. If he lied, he could be further away from where he wanted to be. And so, Benjamin felt fine with answering the question as best as he thought he could answer it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's where I'm from,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I'm from New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Lizette Gohara said. &#8220;I've never met anyone from New York before. I mean, I've certainly heard of it. But, here you are standing before me, flesh and blood, a living New Yorker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He means Castle Newer,&#8221; Selma said as she moved Lizette Gohara's hand away from her mouth. &#8220;He's delusional and he doesn't know where he needs to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, young girl. I think your friend knows exactly where he'd like to go. He'd like to leave this land. He'd like to go to New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says that but he doesn't know where New York is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, regardless, I'm not going to be able to help you get to New York,&#8221; Lizette Gohara said as she moved around her desk to a large filing cabinet against a wall. &#8220;I can, however, offer you some fantastic prices on trips that have been extremely popular this year.&#8221; She turned her head to face both Selma and Benjamin. &#8220;Would you like to hear about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>A chill ripped through Benjamin's body as he feared what this woman was capable of doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Selma and Benjamin said in unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why that's wonderful! Let's start with the islands!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lizette Gohara threw open a cabinet door and pulled out several posters featuring many islands. She danced around the room as a ballet dancer would move about a stage. She placed posters on every wall, posters of islands Benjamin had never seen before. He did not know such places existed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Islands, you see, are beautiful places to be. You can escape. You can be alone. You can have your own personal, lovely prison-- I mean vacation! Vacation! What do you think? Shall we send the two of your to an island?&#8221; Lizette Gohara said as she once again leaned so close to Benjamin and Selma's faces that Benjamin thought they would touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;How would we get there?&#8221; Benjamin asked. &#8220;I don't see any islands from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lizette Gohara pretended to look through the window to see if she could identify any islands in the distance. Benjamin knew there were no islands because he could see everything when he was removing that small spec of dust.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you're right. You cannot see any of the islands here. It'll be a longer train ride and you'll eventually have to take a boat. But, it's quite safe and the boats haven't sunk in many years. So what do you say, would you like to see the islands?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin knew he did not want to go to the islands. He wanted to go home and an island meant that he would be stuck somewhere else.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think I would do well on the islands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't like the sun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm afraid of sharks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't have to go in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll probably go in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't go in the water. There are sharks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you have anything on land?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lizette Gohara tore down all the posters and danced back to the cabinet where she opened another shelf. This time, she began to place posters on the wall of beautiful mountain resorts with waterfalls that clung onto the sides of cliffs as they weaved through trees and grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the islands aren't to your liking, how about an escape to the mountains where there promises to be amazing wildlife, adventure, and certainly no sharks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is much better, I suppose, because of there being no sharks,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, then you'll take it! I can book a trip for two to leave in an hour. Does that work? Would you like to spend your vacation in a place your friends will be jail, I mean jealous of. They'll be jealous. I'm sure of it. So, two then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we want to go on a long train ride,&#8221; Selma said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A long train ride?&#8221; Lizette Gohara asked with confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Selma said slowly. &#8220;Do you have any trips that go to many places in a short period of time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don't know. All the trips I have ready to schedule go to one place. I mean, you'll stay in one place. It's not that they all go to the same place. That would be silly,&#8221; Lizette Gohara laughed loudly in a quite obnoxious way. &#8220;I don't think I have any trips that would take you around from place to place. Why would you want such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin thought he knew what Selma was planning. If they travelled from place to place, eventually they would find an exit. He was beginning to question whether Lizette Gohara was telling the truth or not. He was beginning to think that she was not as real as he thought she might be. In fact, he began to wonder if she had an plan of her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;We like to ride trains,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;We're not ones to stay still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, obviously not. I mean, you've presumably been to New York--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Castle Newer,&#8221; Selma interjected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it's Castle Newer,&#8221; Lizette Gohara said slowly as her eyebrows started to narrow. &#8220;I doubt you have any interest in Castle Newer. No one wants to go to Castle Newer.&#8221; </p>

<p>Lizette Gohara was walking slowly to Selma, her arms at her sides like a preying mantis approaching a small insect. </p>

<p>&#8220;I think there's something you two are trying to hide from me.&#8221; </p>

<p>She grabbed Selma by the shoulders and stared deep into her eyes. Benjamin did not know how to react. He stepped backward until he touched the wall. He wanted to help Selma but he didn't know how. </p>

<p>&#8220;And you know what,&#8221; Lizette Gohara continued. &#8220;I don't care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don't you care?&#8221; Benjamin asked because he thought he could distract her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don't I care?&#8221; Lizette Gohara said as she grabbed Benjamin and pushed him into Selma's shoulders. The two tried to free themselves but her strength was too much. &#8220;I don't care because you two are going nowhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nowhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nowhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now that I think about it, the islands sound great,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly. &#8220;I can handle the sharks. I'll just stay out of the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You two will be going nowhere,&#8221; she said fiercely. &#8220;Well, that's a lie, actually. Guards!&#8221;</p>

<p>The door behind them burst open and dozens of men dressed in blue approached Benjamin and Selma. The guards grabbed their arms and legs to prevent them from moving. Benjamin felt himself being hoisted into the ground, unable to free himself of their grasps.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're both going to jail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jail!&#8221; Benjamin yelled. &#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For trespassing! You're obviously not from here. And even worse, you might be from New York!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the last time, there's nothing wrong with New York!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Save it for the Queen. If you're not from here, you're a nightmare to deal with. And you, young lady,&#8221; she said as she turned to Selma. &#8220;I'm quite disappointed that someone of your upbringing would associate with someone like him. It's quite shameful really. Don't you know any other little boys your own age of your own kind? Take them away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! We just want to leave the castle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Away! Away with them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin and Selma were thrown into the elevator with the guards surrounding them. Not one of them made a sound as they descended to the ground. Benjamin was not sure where they were going but he knew that going to the travel agent was a bad idea. And unexpectedly, he saw in Selma's expression that she must have also realized it was a bad idea. He thought he saw her start to cry but she turned her face away from him quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to leave,&#8221; she said sternly.</p>

<p>The guards didn't move. They stared at the number of floors remaining. There were still over two-thousand left and they were passing three floor every second.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; Benjamin asked in an attempt to whisper. &#8220;We're surrounded by guards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Selma blurted out. &#8220;We'll think of something but we cannot get in trouble here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? What'll happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>The guards all cleared their throats at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let's not talk about it,&#8221; Selma said as she sulked into the corner.</p>

<p>For the first time since he saw her, Benjamin realized that Selma was capable of being defeated. She had always been so strong and forceful that he never imagined someone like her could also be vulnerable. It made him start to wonder if someone as scared and cowardly could be the opposite as well. And if Selma was feeling down at that moment, he knew that he had to be the one to bring her back. She had led him for so long. It was his turn.</p>

<p>When the elevator reached the second floor, it stopped. Benjamin thought that certainly no one would try to get on this elevator. There was no room. And, no one was trying to get on. He, Selma, and the guards were all going to leave. The guards hurried them from the elevator and down a long hall to a dark purple glass room with a small sign that read <i>Judgment Room</i>. The guards shoved Benjamin and Selma into the empty room and then closed the door tightly. Benjamin heard three locks turn before he heard footsteps run away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how we're going to get out of here,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>He didn't. But, he thought that if he convinced Selma that he had a plan, she would become less sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't have plan,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? I have a plan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don't. I can tell when you're lying. Your eyebrows are always raised when you're lying and your eyebrows are raised right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin paused for a second and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe the plan was going to be amazing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't have a plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he could respond, a television screen the size of one of the walls turned on and on it appeared a frail, skinny woman dressed in ornate white robes with a golden crown upon her head. She looked like she had just been woken from a nap and she moved her head and arms slowly. Benjamin thought she looked exactly like a sea turtle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the trespassers?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Benjamin answered. &#8220;We were here to book a vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, we don't book vacations to trespassers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We weren't trespassing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, you would have been booked a vacation,&#8221; she said as she wiped her mouth with a fuzzy cloth. The video occasionally had static that caused the image to distort. &#8220;My name is Queen Sey Mour and I'm here to hand you your judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we haven't done anything wrong,&#8221; Selma said sternly. &#8220;And, you haven't listened to our story yet. You can't judge us without knowing what our story is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, please,&#8221; Queen Sey Mour said. Benjamin looked at Selma, not realizing that the young girl might know the older Queen. &#8220;You should know better than to travel around with a nightmare of a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He's not a nightmare,&#8221; Selma protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's not for discussion right now. We are here to discuss your punishment. And for that I decree that--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can't punish us without hearing our side of the story,&#8221; Selma protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, I've got lots of day dreams to handle today. I cannot deal with your behavior right now. If you want me to tell your mother where you are, you should continue behaving badly. But if you want me to not mention anything to her, I suggest you keep your mouth shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it won't be a bad punishment?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;For her, it won't. For nightmares, it will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He's not a nightmare,&#8221; Selma said as she stamped her foot on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I enjoyed hearing your story, Selma. Now, please quiet down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Queen of Sey Mour adjusted her sunglasses and read from a bright white piece of paper handed to her from someone offscreen. Benjamin watched as this old lady squinted her eyes like she was trying to find the words on the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the complaint of trespassing on Castle Ehtsetra, Selma Applebaum receives a punishment of a day of community service,&#8221; the queen read.</p>

<p>Benjamin didn't think that the punishment was so harsh. Certainly, he wouldn't mind doing some community service as well. And if it meant he could eventually leave the castle to find another path to leave, he was fine with this punishment. He didn't know why he was so scared earlier.</p>

<p>&#8220;And in the complaint of trespassing on Castle Ehtsetra and for being a nightmare, the nightmare will have his head chopped off.&#8221;</p>


























<h1 id="chapter24">Chapter 24: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Door</h1>

<p>The television screen shut off immediately. Benjamin and Selma stood alone in the room, both not looking at each other. It could not be real, Benjamin thought to himself. He knew he was trapped in this room but there could not be any chopping of heads anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; Selma dragged the word out for a while. &#8220;That was a surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll say,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;You got a day of community service and I'm going to lose my head. That doesn't seem fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don't want me to lose my head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I want a day of community service as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right. That would've been better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So what do we do now?&#8221; Benjamin asked as he realized this may be real.</p>

<p>&#8220;The way I see it we have two options. You can lose your head or we're going to have to escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or, I could convince them that I'm not a nightmare. How can I do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's impossible. Once you're called a nightmare, you're stuck with it. The only way to convince anyone is to get King Bernard Zwirn to clear your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to lose your head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Let's escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dozens and dozens of guards dressed in blue stormed the room and took Selma and Benjamin away. There was no use struggling because they were outnumbered. Benjamin wondered how they were going to escape if they were constantly surrounded by so many people.</p>

<p>They were rushed through a long wide glass room with doors at the end that reached to the ceiling. Benjamin could already see what was ahead through the glass. There was some sort of glass platform with a glass guillotine positioned on top. As he was pushed outside the skyscraper into the open air, he could see that there was indeed a machine ready to remove his head. The reality of the situation sunk in. Not only would he not be able to get back home, he would be losing his head in the process.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, we have to do something!&#8221; Benjamin yelled as he was being dragged up glass stairs to the top of the glass platform. &#8220;Selma!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm thinking, I'm thinking!&#8221; Selma yelled as she was taken to a viewing area at the base of the platform. She was chained to a chair and despite her struggles, she could not free herself. &#8220;Run away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run? I can't get myself free of their grips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just run! I'll be fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin squirmed back and forth as the only guard on the platform pushed him closer and closer to the guillotine.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not working, Selma!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run! Or, jump! Any way you can to get out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn't good!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin jumped and squirmed and attempted to run but in every attempt, he was being overpowered. The guard was too strong and Benjamin was too weak. He tried moving every part of his body but nothing could free himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try harder!&#8221; Selma yelled as the guards tightened her chains to the chair.</p>

<p>And then, Benjamin jumped and inadvertently hit his head straight into the guard's head. Benjamin did not want to do this. It hurt. In his attempts to jump and move and free himself, it was an unavoidable collision. And despite the collision, the guard was physically uninjured. In fact, he was fine. But in the process of hitting the guard in the head, Benjamin knocked the man's sunglasses off his head. That was when something peculiar happened. The guard froze, his eyes wide open, staring forward. He was still alive. He was breathing. It was just that he looked like he was in a trance. So at that moment, Benjamin was free, at least from that one guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sunglasses!&#8221; Benjamin yelled to Selma. &#8220;Knock their sunglasses off their faces!&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma only had one hand free as the guards continued to tie her to the chair. But with that one hand, she swiped at one of the guard's faces and knocked his sunglasses to the ground. Immediately upon having the sunglasses removed, that guard too froze. And so, Selma swiped at the other guard who realized what had happened to his friend. He ducked away and continued to try to overpower Selma. But then, Benjamin ran down the stairs from the platform and hit his sunglasses onto the ground. The guard was stuck in a trance and Benjamin was able to release Selma from the chair as dozens of other guards descended upon them.</p>

<p>One by one, Selma and Benjamin fought back against the men in blue suits. They ducked when the guards would try to grab them and then swung at their heads to remove their sunglasses. It was a fast, manic, panicked, energetic affair. Selma and Benjamin had knocked over forty sunglasses, leaving forty men staring into the distance. They didn't flinch. They didn't move. They just stayed in the position they were in when their sunglasses were removed.</p>

<p>And after Selma and Benjamin surrounded the last guard, jumping at his head to unhinge his sunglasses, they sat in the middle of these people, exhausted and confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good job,&#8221; Selma said as they sat with their backs to one another, worried that more guards would be on their way. &#8220;How did you know to remove the sunglasses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't,&#8221; Benjamin said as he scanned the horizon for more blue suits. &#8220;I accidentally knocked them off. I didn't even want to. What happened to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma walked up to one of the guards and waved her hand in front of his eyes. He still didn't move. He was as still as a statue.</p>

<p>&#8220;They're daydreaming,&#8221; Selma said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daydreaming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The sunglasses must prevent them from dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So if they put the sunglasses back on, they'll come back to attack us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin jumped to his feet and gathered all of the sunglasses that had been strewn across the glass floor. When he had them all, he quickly broke each one of them into two pieces. This, he thought, would make them unusable to the guards. They could finally escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let's go!&#8221; he yelled to Selma as he grabbed her hand.</p>

<p>They ran through a glass hallway, away from the guards.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to find the train that everyone takes when they start their holiday. The one that Lizette Gohara talked about. We'll get on that train and leave the castle,&#8221; Selma said as they ran away, one pulling the other.</p>

<p>As they turned a corner, a video screen appeared on the glass wall in front of them. It flickered briefly and then Benjamin saw the unmistakable image of Queen Sey Mour.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you!&#8221; Queen Sey Mour yelled. &#8220;You stop running this instant!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin didn't think twice. He grabbed Selma's hand and pulled her along as they ran faster and faster. They moved through a glass maze in the castle's plaza, searching for a train. As they turned a corner, the screen with Queen Sey Mour appeared again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you're going to leave?&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;You aren't going to leave, nightmare.&#8221;</p>

<p>They continued running, turning whenever they thought one path might be better than another. Despite the walls and everything around them being made of glass, it was still difficult to find a train in the distance. It was especially difficult when Queen Sey Mour continued to appear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nightmare, you will not destroy my castle,&#8221; Queen Sey Mour threatened. </p>

<p>Benjamin wished that he could explain to the woman that he was not a nightmare. But, this was not the time. He was not about to lose his head. He knew he needed to leave as quickly as possible. Another video screen appeared as Selma thought she saw the train preparing to depart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma! I'm informing your mother of your whereabouts!&#8221; Queen Sey Mour screamed. &#8220;We have fought the nightmares for a long time and they have finally been weakened! I will not have a nightmare in my castle destroyed dreams for innocent people.&#8221;</p>

<p>It made Benjamin angry that Queen Sey Mour continued to refer to him as a nightmare. But, he kept his focus and continued to run faster, pulling Selma along even when she started to slow down.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; Selma yelled as a puff of smoke burst into the air above a train made of blue and red glass. &#8220;Over there!&#8221;</p>

<p>They ran as the train started to lunge forward. One last screen appeared on the castle wall as Benjamin climbed the stairs on the side of the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nightmare, don't you ever return!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;If you come back, you'll lose more than your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>The train moved forward and Benjamin pulled Selma up the staircase with all of his strength. As the train departed the castle, the two children sat next to each other, physically exhausted and mentally beaten down. Surely, Benjamin thought, Queen Sey Mour would one day learn that he was not a nightmare. And in order for that day to occur, Benjamin needed to leave this place. He needed to go back to New York. Because here, he realized, he could not explain himself to people who were not willing to listen to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does this go?&#8221; Benjamin asked Selma about the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no idea,&#8221; Selma said quickly. &#8220;We just needed to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin went through his backpack and removed the map that had been given to him by Myrna Delacourte. It was worn now. But, the exit and several other key places were still clearly visible. Benjamin scanned the skyline to see in what direction they might be headed. Selma watched Benjamin struggle with reading the map. It was frustrating to Benjamin because he could not easily figure out where he was. He pulled on his hair and rotated the map back and forth, still unable to guess where the train was going. He threw the map into his backpack and threw his head upon his hands. It seemed like he would never get back home.</p>

<p>Selma reached across Benjamin and took his backpack. She opened his map and looked at it briefly, sharing the same confused face that Benjamin had. Benjamin didn't look up. He continued to sulk as he watched the ground move like a blur of color.</p>

<p>&#8220;We're here,&#8221; Selma said. &#8220;I'm pretty sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin turned his head to look in her direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; she said as she pointed at the map. &#8220;It's not marked. Castle Ehtsetra isn't marked. But, I'm pretty sure we're here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin moved next to her so that he could look at the map as well. He didn't know if she was right but had a feeling that he should trust her. She knew a lot more than he did about this land.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, we're close to the exit,&#8221; he said as he pointed at the map.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it's not too far away,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If we ride the train for a little bit longer, we'll be able to get off and walk the rest of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin felt a renewed sense of encouragement. Even if Selma was wrong, he was happy knowing that they had a plan. They would wait for the train to stop at the next station, and then they'd walk to the exit. If the exit wasn't there, they would walk back to the train.</p>

<p>When the train came to the station, Benjamin and Selma departed quickly, worried that there might have been other guards on the train. But as soon as they stepped from the train, it departed again, leaving them alone in a remote area. Birds flew from tree to tree while alligators roamed the stagnant water. It was an unlikely location for a train station because it did not seem like there was a castle nearby.</p>

<p>Selma retrieved Benjamin's map and located where the exit might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to hurry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Because we don't want to be here at night time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happens at night time?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We're too close to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle. If he wanted to unleash nightmares, we would be the first to get them. We don't want to be here for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked along a thin dirt path that seemed to be the only evidence that people had been here before. As the sun continued to set, they picked up their pace and searched for the exit in the distance. Benjamin didn't know what an exit would look like because he could imagine that this land simply ended with a wall. It had to be something else.</p>

<p>As alligators snapped near their legs, Benjamin and Selma climbed over tree trunks and squeezed their way through thorny bushes to continue along. The path was becoming more muddy and with each step their shoes stuck to the ground. All of this, however, Benjamin was willing to endure because he was finally headed back to New York.</p>

<p>In the distance, they saw it. It was a red barn in the middle of the swamp with large white lettering that read <i>EXIT</i>. A humungous yellow arrow pointed to the door. It was quite remarkable and felt oddly out of place. But Benjamin did not care what it looked like. So long as it was the exit, he was fine with it.</p>

<p>As they approached the door, Benjamin looked at Selma and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; he said as he waited for her to shake his hand. &#8220;Are you going to be able to get back alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was confused why Selma didn't shake his hand. She looked at him like he was behaving in some foreign manner. Maybe, he thought, she just didn't like shaking hands. But Selma crossed her arms and began to narrow her eyebrows at Benjamin. He didn't know why she was getting upset and so, he decided it was well enough that he should be on his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really appreciate your help,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Take care.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he turned to open the barn door, something was amiss. He didn't know why but something felt wrong. He couldn't put his finger on it. He had had an adventure. Perhaps, it was not the adventure that he had hoped for. But, it was an adventure and he had grown a little bit. He still didn't feel as courageous as he would have liked to be. He did feel, however, that he had grown a tad more independent.</p>

<p>He didn't know what it was that didn't feel right. But, he did know the door was locked.</p>

<p>He pulled and pulled and listened to Selma laughing behind him.</p>

<p>It was as locked as a vault.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't have a key?&#8221; Selma asked with disbelief. &#8220;Didn't whoever gave you the map to the exit also give you a key?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin felt defeated. He had come all this way. He had found the exit. And, he never thought the exit might require a key.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought it would be open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma laughed at his pitiful situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you think if the exit was open we'd have people always coming and going?&#8221; she asked with a giggle. &#8220;I can't believe you don't have a key!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can I get a key?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>He was getting a little angry. He had prepared himself to leave and had not anticipated that his only place to depart might be locked. It was excruciatingly painful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only know one person that has a key,&#8221; Selma said calmly. &#8220;I don't know how else you get a key. I thought you knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I thought that maybe it might be unlocked,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Benjamin marched back the way they had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; Selma asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going to get a key. I'm going to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle.&#8221;</p>

























<h1 id="chapter25">Chapter 25: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is Nightmare Castle</h1>

<p>That night, Benjamin and Selma walked further than Benjamin had ever walked in a day. He was determined to get to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle and Selma was determined to make sure he did not get hurt along the way. She could barely keep pace with Benjamin he was moving as fast as his body could take him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slow down!&#8221; Selma yelled from behind. &#8220;There's no rush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go home,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you want to go home but whether you go home tonight or tomorrow or the next day or the day after that isn't going to make a difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma was exhausted. She had been through so much with Benjamin and she did not have the same goal that he had. In fact, so long as Benjamin did not hurt himself, she achieved her goal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm tired of being here and I want to go home. And if that means going into Aloysius Trenhaile's castle to get a key, I'm going to get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin didn't even notice how confident and courageous he had suddenly become. He was about to enter a castle that produced nightmares with the intentions of retrieving a key. It was not, he thought, going to be easy. But, he saw no other way to get home.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're going to get killed if you don't stop and think for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There's nothing to think about anymore. I'm going to go into the castle. I'm going to find King Bernard Zwirn. I'm going to get the key. And then, I'm walking back to the exit in the swamp. And then, I'll say goodbye to you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma didn't want to stop Benjamin's enthusiasm for getting the key. She knew that it was his only way home. King Bernard Zwirn was the only person who knew where Benjamin had come from. He was the only person that could actually send Benjamin home. But to get to King Bernard Zwirn in Aloysius Trenhaile's castle was as dangerous as trying to spoonfeed a monster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that it?&#8221; Benjamin pointed to a volcano in the distance that spewed lava thousands of feet into the air.</p>

<p>Selma took one look and gave Benjamin a thumbs up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That's Aloysius Trenhaile's castle. I've never been there. I've only seen drawings. And it looks so much worse in person than it does in anything I've ever seen. You know, Benjamin. I wonder if there's another way we can get you back home. Maybe we can go back to Castle Ehtahl and get the others. We'll bring them all back and then we can all go in together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma turned to face Benjamin and upon doing so, she noticed that he had already left and was walking down a hill to the castle that sat in the volcano a mile away. She let out a loud sigh and then ran to catch up with Benjamin. Benjamin was still so focused on finding an exit he did not consider the alternatives that might happen. His only alternative that he worried about was not getting home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going to go inside,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;So you can wait outside if you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I want?&#8221; Selma asked with confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is my problem. You don't have to go inside if you don't want to. It's going to be dangerous and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, it's going to be beyond dangerous. This is one of the worst places imaginable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it's not the worst place imaginable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no. But any castle that produces nightmares is an awful place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There's more than one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; Selma said. &#8220;There's a dozen. They all surround a fortress in the middle some distance away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What's in the fortress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let's not talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, so do you have any recommendations for how I can get inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the first thing is that you should probably try not to get killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, I'll try not to get killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that's about it. These nightmares are awful. It took our castles decades to keep all the nightmares away. They've been here for so long and have only recently started to attack us again. Fighting nightmares is one of the most difficult things I know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, no advice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't have any,&#8221; she said as she threw her hands in the air. &#8220;If we knew how to destroy the nightmares, we would have done it already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I'll just try to stay alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yup,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just try to stay alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked up the volcano, dodging lava and ash as it fell from the sky all around them. It started to get louder and noisier the closer they got to the walls, a sound that was similar to a boiling pot of water. The walls were darker and taller than any of the walls Benjamin had yet seen. They were dirty and smelly and covered with disgusting liquids that rolled down their sides. And unexpectedly, there was no door. There was no drawbridge or doorbell or small opening in which Benjamin could enter. It looked like the kind of place that did not let anything inside leave.</p>

<p>Benjamin could hear the sounds of screaming and yelling as he approached the rocky exterior of a wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get back!&#8221; Selma yelled as she pulled him behind a piece of cooled lava. &#8220;They're going to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Benjamin asked as he ducked near Selma.</p>

<p>At that moment, three screeching dragons the size of buses flew overhead. Benjamin could see fire in their eyes and their talons looked like they could break anything with ease. They flew around in a pattern like they were searching for something inside the castle. The screams grew louder as the dragons hissed and snarled at something on the other side.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to climb the wall,&#8221; Selma said to Benjamin. &#8220;But only once the dragons disappear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; Benjamin asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I'm going to let you go in there and die? Do you know how much work it'll be for me to explain to everyone what happened to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which wall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That one,&#8221; Selma said as she pointed to a wall that had more darkness upon it than the others.</p>

<p>As more dragons soared around the castle, Benjamin and Selma sprinted to the wall. A glass wall would have been difficult to climb. But this wall was rather easier because it had been damaged so many times by falling lava. And Benjamin was beginning to think that the walls weren't built so that they could keep people out. They had been built to keep the nightmares inside.</p>

<p>They climbed the wall, rocks slipping underneath them as they went higher. Benjamin noticed that he was further up than Selma and so, he stopped and held his position. He didn't want to be in a place where he couldn't help her if she needed it. When Selma got to his spot, they climbed side by side until they reached the top.</p>

<p>And at the top, Benjamin saw the worst sight he had ever seen. On the other side of the wall was the largest army Benjamin had ever seen. Aloysius Trenhaile was preparing for war. He was going to attack Castle Ehtahl.</p>

<p>Aloysius Trenhaile's castle was littered with broken houses made of rock that lined lava rivers. There were rusty military vehicles that looked like they had been inspired by porcupines, spikes coming out of every side. There were weapons that seemed large enough to destroy any castle Benjamin had seen. And throughout, there were trolls who grunted and growled at each other. There were more skeletons than Benjamin could count on the far east end of the castle. And when one of them moved, Benjamin's stomach turned. There were ghosts scattered throughout and awful creatures that Benjamin could not name everywhere. They looked like the horrifying creatures that only a nightmare could produce. It was worse than Benjamin imagined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what?&#8221; he said to Selma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay alive,&#8221; she said calmly. &#8220;The key is going to be with King Bernard Zwirn. And, he's probably held captive in that tower.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the center of the castle was a tower that even lava could not destroy. It had a staircase that wrapped around its exterior dozens of times before it reached the top. The dark, dirty exterior made it almost invisible against the night sky. If it wasn't for the large fire at the top, Benjamin was sure he would have missed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We just have to get to the top somehow,&#8221; Benjamin said to Selma.</p>

<p>He scanned the castle for an easy path to the tower but it was difficult to find given the darkness. The stairs were the most obvious choice, he thought. But, he would probably be seen. If there was a way he could disguise himself, he could walk through unseen.</p>

<p>As he was going to whisper his plan to Selma, the three dragons suddenly appeared on the other side of the castle walls. They stared at Benjamin and Selma who were only ten feet away. Benjamin could feel the searing hot air the dragons were exhaling. They were doomed, he thought.</p>

<p>One of the dragons grabbed Selma and flew into the darkness. Benjamin tried to reach for her but it was too late. The other two dragons grabbed Benjamin and flew him across the castle and above the lava river. He was certain that he was going to die at that moment. The dragons would tear him to pieces. It was a dreadful situation and Benjamin did not know how to free himself.</p>

<p>He wished that he could fall. If he was so hot or so cold that he would hurt the dragons, they would drop him. Or, if he was made of spikes or if he was slippery, they would drop him. Or, if he was extremely heavy or big or tiny or unseen, they would drop him. And at that moment, all he wanted was to be dropped, safely and not torn to pieces.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and imagined what it would be like to be all those things that the dragons couldn't hold. And suddenly and unexpectedly, he opened his eyes and found himself in a freefall. There was not much distance between him and the ground but with lava everywhere, he was still concerned. Luckily, he fell directly into the back of a cart filled with coal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma!&#8221; he yelled into the empty darkness.</p>

<p>The cart jolted forward and Benjamin hid among the coal. The army was much larger than Benjamin had guessed. He looked ahead and noticed that he was only a short distance away from the tower. But he also noticed that the cart was headed directly for the staircase that ran along the tower. As it approached, Benjamin saw that the disgusting troll that was pulling the cart was going to attempt to pull the cart up the staircase.</p>

<p>The troll pulled the cart up one step and Benjamin was jostled back and forth. He did not like being thrown about in such a violent way. The troll pulled the cart up another step and Benjamin hit his head against the iron wall of the cart. And then another step and Benjamin hit his back against the coal. There were hundreds of stairs and if the troll was going to continue to pull the cart this way, Benjamin thought he would be unconscious before he arrived.</p>

<p>He imagined what it would be like if there were no steps going up but instead it was a smooth ride all the way to top. It would be a gentle ride and the troll could go a little faster. And when he got to the top, Benjamin could still have his consciousness. When he stopped imagining what such a ride would be like, he opened his eyes and realized that he was at the top of the tower. The sight baffled him. Although the tower looked high from the ground, it felt much taller here. And, he could see the full violence and size of the volcano. It was dreadful and around it, thousands of beasts prepared for battle.</p>

<p>Benjamin waited for the troll to leave and then he snuck into the tower's square room where a large fire burned at the top. As soon as he entered, he heard a familiar voice that he had not heard from for a really long time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin?&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn asked.</p>

<p>The king was seated in an iron cage stuck in the air. Although it hadn't been a long time since Benjamin had last seen him, he looked remarkably older and weaker. Benjamin knew the king was in trouble. There was no one else in the room. There was just a gigantic fire and a loud, vibrating machine in the middle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin! What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a long story but I'm trying to leave,&#8221; Benjamin whispered. &#8220;And I need a key to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm sorry I couldn't get you out earlier, Benjamin. I didn't expect things to go this direction. And you can't stay here. I don't know how you got in but you're in a lot of trouble. If my brother finds you, you're going to be in a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother is Aloysius Trenhaile?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire roared and lightning struck the tower. The demons, ghosts, and horrid creatures all screamed in unison at the base of the castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, you cannot say that name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He's coming back. He's making nightmares. Benjamin, you should probably leave. I don't know that you'll be able to help me. You just have to tell someone that I'm still alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll tell Selma,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma's with you? Yes, I got kicked out of Castle Ehtahl by Thalia Nachamie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought Thalia Nachamie might have taken control. It's not good times for dreaming, Benjamin. Dreams may soon come to an end. So, you should leave. If my brother finds you, he's going to try to hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another roar in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;King Zwirn, how can we destroy the nightmares?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We've never been able to figure it out, Benjamin. If we can stop this machine here, we'll be able to temporarily stop their production. But so long as there are dreams, there are bound to be people who want to create nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So if I turn off this machine, I'll have stopped the nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but we don't know how to turn it off. My brother is the only person who knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think anything. You don't have much time. You're in real danger. The key is on the other side of the room and you need to get it quickly before my brother returns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked and spotted the small silver key on the other side of the room. He ran to the wall and climbed an iron ladder that led to the ceiling. With one hand after another, Benjamin imagined scaling the ladder faster than he felt he was capable of moving. When he arrived at the top, he grabbed the key and could hear King Bernard Zwirn applauding on the other side. Benjamin turned and saw the largest smile he had ever seen the king wear. But Benjamin did not realize what he had done. He had simply climbed the ladder. And now, he could finally leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo, Benjamin!&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn yelled. &#8220;Now, leave! Go find someone who can help save me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without thinking, Benjamin ran down the ladder as quickly as he had climbed up it. He hit the ground and held the key out for King Bernard Zwirn to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know how you got in here, Benjamin,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said. &#8220;But if there's anyone who knows how to escape, it's probably you. Trust your own instincts and tell everyone that I'm still alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long, King Zwirn,&#8221; Benjamin yelled in response. &#8220;It was great to meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bye, Benjamin. I hope you can continue dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin turned to leave and immediately upon trying to exit, Aloysius Trenhaile appeared.</p>
























<h1 id="chapter26">Chapter 26: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Nightmarer</h1>

<p>He was much taller than Benjamin expected. His body was thin like a crane. He stood like a young tree with branches arms that stretched outward like crooked branches. His fingers extended outwards like long, narrow daggers. His elbows, knees, and shoulders were sharp, not smooth like a normal person's. His feet were narrow and long while his ears were wide and short. His nose arched forward like a parrot's nose and his eyes sunk into his face like coals on a beach. And as he walked toward Benjamin, he moved like a sly fox stalking his prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, this is the one?&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile asked King Bernard Zwirn amid lightning and thunder. &#8220;You told me I'd never come upon him. That he'd come upon me. And with what luck, here he is. What is your name, child?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin hadn't moved. He didn't know how to interact with this man that had been so feared by so many. This man was responsible for destroying dreams in the castles and he had an army ready to destroy dreams forever. He was the reason dreams were disappearing in New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the boy alone!&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn yelled from the cage. &#8220;He causes you no harm. Let him be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloysius Trenhaile walked around Benjamin several times, his legs taking long strides. His hands were behind his back. Benjamin felt like the man was going to grab him if he tried to flee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bernard, that can't happen,&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile said calmly. &#8220;Any child that comes to my castle surely is not worthy of letting go free. Why is he here, Bernard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was just leaving, Aloysius! Let him be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why leave now? Don't you want to see the release of my greatest creation yet? I was just about to create a nightmare's nightmare. Stick around, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chains burst from the ground and wall. They wrapped themselves around Benjamin's arms and legs so quickly that Benjamin didn't have any time to react. The rusty chains pulled Benjamin into the air next to King Bernard Zwirn.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can stay there,&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile said with an annoyed, calm voice. &#8220;You'll be witness to something that will change human history. This will revolutionize the way people live. This will change the way people think. For too long, there has been a divide between the people who can dream and those who cannot. But, nightmares do not discriminate. Nightmares affect everyone. And tonight, this machine will make sure that no one dreams. The dreamers will stop dreaming and be just like the people who are unable to dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't understand,&#8221; Benjamin said meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What don't you understand. Nightmares are fair. Dreams are unfair. Not everyone can dream, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don't you make dreams for the people who cannot dream?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloysius Trenhaile let out a long, loud laugh that caused the fire at the top of the room to roar. Benjamin tried to avert his eyes as lava fell throughout the room from the volcano outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;You assume that everyone wants to dream!&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile screamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone wants a dream,&#8221; Benjamin replied without thinking that responding might make the situation much worse.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile exclaimed. &#8220;Everyone does not want a dream! Lots of people want to live life without a dream! The dreamers always think that everyone should have a dream. But, they're wrong! And for that, boy, the dreamers will be punished! The dreamers will be nightmarers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nightmarers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! They will no longer have dreams but nightmares!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, that's not even a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>King Bernard Zwirn put his finger to his lips and shook his head back and forth quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Benjamin. Don't say that,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn whispered to Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nightmarers is now a word. I invented it. It means a dreamer who only has nightmares!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin didn't understand what had led Aloysius Trenhaile to come to this conclusion. If there were no dreamers, the world would be a sadder place, he thought. It would be filled with people who just did what they were told, people who did not think beyond what they saw, people who did not care about creativity, people who did not try to stretch their minds, people who were insecure, people who were afraid of being different, people who were exactly the same as everyone else. It seemed to be an awful place. And, it was certainly a place Benjamin did not want to live. He wanted dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring in the catalyst!&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile yelled as he inspected the complicated nightmare machine in the center of the room. </p>

<p>It was made of many electrical parts Benjamin could not identify. It looked so much more complicated than the dream machine in Cafe Ehtahl. From four doors on all sides of the room, demons entered with various pieces of equipment. They began to plug cords into the nightmare machine and pull levers that sent sparks flying into the air. The nightmare machine was slowly coming to life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, one more thing, Bernard,&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile said amid the chaos of the awful creatures running around. &#8220;We have the girl, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma!&#8221; Benjamin yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aloysius, you let her go! She's here to do no harm!&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn yelled back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know why she's here. I assume she's here to save you. But, we both know you can't be saved,&#8221; Aloysius replied.</p>

<p>Trolls entered and began putting the finishing touches on the nightmare machine, which started to make lots of noise and generate more sparks. Every so often, a spark would explode so much that it looked like a firework. To Benjamin, the nightmare machine looked like it was going to explode. Even the demons and trolls and other disgusting beasts on the floor began to look at it with fear. Some slowly backed away and ran down the exterior staircase while others admired the lights and noises with amazement. Benjamin and King Bernard Zwirn continued to avert their eyes. It was too bright to look directly at and too loud to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, you have to get out of here,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at the chains that held him in the air. He jostled his body back and forth but could not free himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; Benjamin asked. &#8220;I'm stuck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get to this castle? How did you get up this tower? How did you climb that broken ladder to get that key? That ladder only goes halfway up the wall but you somehow managed to climb a ladder all the way to the top.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked across the room and noticed that the ladder did indeed stop halfway up the wall. But, that wasn't what he remembered. He remembered climbing a ladder all the way to the top. In fact, he was sure a ladder went all the way to the top because he wouldn't have been able to climb it otherwise. And yet as he looked across the room, the ladder definitely stopped well short. Maybe, he thought, he imagined it. Maybe that was why King Bernard Zwirn was clapping as loudly as he was. Maybe it was all in Benjamin's mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can free yourself, Benjamin. You're the only one who can. You just have to imagine yourself being freed,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn whispered. &#8220;I believe you can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin didn't understand what the king meant. He didn't try to create a ladder that extended all the way to the top of the ceiling. He didn't try to move the troll and the coal cart from the bottom of the tower to the top. He didn't try to do anything. They just sort of happened. How could I try to imagine something so creative, he thought.</p>

<p>His mind started to wonder as he watched pieces of lava fly into the room through the open roof above. He wondered how it was possible that he hadn't been hit by lava yet. He was glad he hadn't been hit by lava because that surely would have hurt. But with all of the pieces falling into the room, it was surprising that nothing hit him, King Bernard Zwirn, or the nightmare machine that Aloysius Trenhaile continued to work on. If only a piece of lava would fall through the ceiling and hit the iron chains, Benjamin would be free. He imagined how it would be, a small piece of lava moving so fast that it would melt the chains instantly and let him free.</p>

<p>And the next thing he realized, he was on the ground.</p>

<p>Aloysius Trenhaile turned to face Benjamin, his face as angry and upset as a face could make. He started to march toward Benjamin but Benjamin closed his eyes and imagined that lava was hailing down on the nightmare machine. Aloysius Trenhaile screamed and roared loudly. Benjamin opened his eyes to find that the machine had been hit by lava several times. Trolls and demons ran back into the room. They desperately tried to control the melting structure and fire that had started on the machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to die!&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile screamed at Benjamin.</p>

<p>Benjamin moved backwards and looked up to King Bernard Zwirn.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did it! Leave!&#8221; the king yelled. &#8220;Go! Hurry! Find Selma!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin turned and ran down the exterior of the tower, listening to the king shout instructions to him as he moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will stop them for now. Go find Selma and tell the others that I'm alive! They must come at once to free me. It will take all the dream castles to destroy this castle but we must do so before Aloysius has an opportunity to create this nightmare's nightmare.&#8221;</p>

<p>He didn't know where Selma might be. All around him, the awful creatures of Aloysius Trenhaile's castle began to stir with confusion as to what was happening at the top of the tower. It was chaos and amid it all, Benjamin yelled for Selma wherever he could. The last thing he remembered was that she was taken away by a dragon. So if he found a dragon, he could find Selma.</p>

<p>In the sky, there was a dragon in the distance and Benjamin watched where it was headed. As trolls and skeletons climbed the tower, Benjamin proceeded to descend and follow where the dragon went. As it neared the castle, it changed directions quickly to fly toward the tower. And as it flew up the tower, Benjamin saw the other two dragons leave a destroyed house near the lava river.</p>

<p>He ran as quickly as he could and crossed a terribly hot bridge over the lava. Without thinking, he busted down the door. But there was no monster, only Selma and her foot chained to the ground. Without thinking, Benjamin imagined the roof being pulled off the house and a small piece of lava melting the chain. When he opened his eyes, he saw that the roof was gone, the iron chain had been cut, and Selma had a shocked expression on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to hurry!&#8221; Benjamin yelled to her.</p>

<p>She still didn't move so Benjamin grabbed her arm and led her through the destroyed castle and onto the bridge over the lava river. They ran among the chaos of trolls and ghosts trying to make their way up to the tower. At the top, Benjamin could see that the fire was raging more and more. He worried about King Bernard Zwirn but he knew he had his instructions. He had to get help.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Selma yelled as they ran further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aloysius Trenhaile created a nightmare machine that can create a nightmare's nightmare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nightmare's nightmare. It's a nightmare that will stop everyone from dreaming. There would be no more dreamers. Only nightmarers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's not a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to tell him but he wouldn't listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we have to stop it!&#8221; Selma yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did!&#8221; Benjamin replied. &#8220;I don't know exactly how but lava melted parts of it. They can't use it. It's broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find King Zwirn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. He's up there in the tower. I got the key and then Aloysius entered and started the nightmare machine. I was chained to the wall and I imagined lava destroying the machine and setting me free. And then, I realized I was free. Aloysius is really angry right now. We have to leave before he finds me or else he'll kill me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! Wait. I'm confused. Why didn't you set King Zwirn free too?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin paused for a moment while they were running to think. He could have set King Zwirn free but that wasn't what King Zwirn told him to do. He told Benjamin to leave and get help. And, that's what Benjamin was going to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me to leave and get help. He said that I should let everyone know that he is still alive. Everyone needs to come back and battle this castle,&#8221; Benjamin said to Selma.</p>

<p>She didn't look pleased with his response but continued to sprint for the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he wants us to get help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he said get the other castles to free him. I guess he thought that Aloysius could only be defeated by the castles.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, the fire at the top of the castle exploded into a large fireball that forced both Benjamin and Selma to turn away. He saw demons and ghosts and skeletons falling off the staircase that surrounded the tower. If they did not move more quickly for the exit, Aloysius may find them.</p>

<p>Benjamin and Selma reached the wall and climbed it as fast as they could. At the top, Benjamin reached into his pocket and tightened a fist around the key. It was still there. King Bernard Zwirn was still at the top of the tower. But now, Benjamin could make sure that everyone knew he was still alive. Selma knew and when Selma went back to Castle Ehtahl, she could tell everyone. They would all come back and set the king free. He would be safe.</p>

<p>And for that night, there would still be dreamers because Benjamin had damaged the nightmare machine. Aloysius Trenhaile could not execute his plan without fixing it first. When the castles free King Bernard Zwirn, the king should be able to lead everyone in defeating Aloysius Trenhaile for good.</p>

<p>This was good, Benjamin thought. He could finally go home to New York.</p>

<p>He nodded as he looked as the disaster before him and then climbed down the other side of the wall. When he got to the bottom, he assisted Selma in safely touching ground. But unexpectedly, Selma didn't share the same happy emotion that he had.</p>

<p>And, he didn't know why.</p>
























<h1 id="chapter27">Chapter 27: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Realization</h1>

<p>Benjamin was ecstatic. He had done it. He had the key. He had done something that he never imagined he was capable of doing. And now, he could leave. He could exit this awful land that had been nothing but difficult and painful. He wanted to go home because although home didn't have any friends or dreams, he was not under attack.</p>

<p>He didn't realize how fast he was walking away from the castle. As excited as he was, he felt as if he was flying. He moved along the land so quickly that he was far ahead of Selma who was only steps outside of the castle. Benjamin turned and started walking backwards so that he could see her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We did it!&#8221; he yelled to her. &#8220;I'm going home!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned around and continued to move faster and faster. After everything he had gone through, events had turned in his favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is wrong with you!&#8221; Selma screamed.</p>

<p>She had her arms stretched as wide as they could extend and her head was pushed forward as far as it could go. Benjamin had not yet seen her this angry. She looked as if he had done something terrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Benjamin said warmly. &#8220;Nothing's wrong with me. I'm really happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you nuts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, look I have the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my--,&#8221; Selma started to say but stopped and paced back and forth. Benjamin watched her pace and grunt loudly with frustration and annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so angry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you serious!&#8221;</p>

<p>He didn't know what to ask next. He needed to figure out what was wrong with Selma but he wasn't sure how to get her to tell him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he began. &#8220;I'm a little confused why you're so upset.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You're confused! Great! You're confused!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, so, you could, you know, tell me why you're so upset? That might be, well, nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma stopped pacing in front of Benjamin. Benjamin was sure she was going to hit him at that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are being so selfish. You don't understand why I'm upset because you're being so selfish!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't understand--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don't understand because I'm here to find the key so that I can go home. That is selfish, yes. But, isn't that what I'm here to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, Benjamin. It is. You're right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; Benjamin said quietly. &#8220;I'm going to continue walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about King Zwirn?&#8221; Selma called out to Benjamin as he walked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about him?&#8221; Benjamin answered without pausing his pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could save him,&#8221; she stated as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could save him?&#8221; Benjamin said as he stopped. &#8220;Selma, did you see that monster? There is absolutely no way I can save him. Someone bigger than me, maybe. Not me. I'd be killed instantly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what happens to him?&#8221; Selma asked as Benjamin again continued to walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; he said because he honestly didn't know. </p>

<p>He did not want King Zwirn to be hurt, to be imprisoned, or to be alone. But, he did not know what he could do to save him. That monster, Aloysius Trenhaile, was bigger, meaner, and tougher than anything Benjamin could ever dream of being. There was no way that Benjamin could save King Zwirn. If he tried, he risked causing more harm to the king. And certainly, Benjamin thought, Selma would not want that.</p>

<p>&#8220;King Bernard Zwirn didn't ask me to save him,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did he <i>need</i> to ask?&#8221; Selma responded.</p>

<p>If they were going to walk back to Castle Ehtahl, he had to think of a plan for saving King Zwirn that would make Selma happy. Benjamin worried that she would run back into the castle and try to save him. If Benjamin could not save the king, Selma could not save the king either.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a plan,&#8221; Benjamin said as he quickened his pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this plan?&#8221; Selma said with an upset tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;We're going to go back to the castle and we're going to tell everyone that we found King Zwirn. Then, we'll bring back everyone so that we can all fight Aloysius Trenhaile together.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was satisfied with this plan because it made sense to him. He alone could not beat Aloysius Trenhaile but perhaps he and an army could defeat the monster and its army. Even a monster as gargantuan as Aloysius Trenhaile would have difficulty fighting thousands of people. This was, Benjamin decided, a good plan. And, he thought to himself, it meant that he could still go home while knowing that he did his best to help King Zwirn.</p>

<p>&#8220;That won't work,&#8221; Selma said. She still had not moved and the gap between Benjamin and Selma grew larger and larger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not going to work because no one in the castle is going to leave. They are too scared of that of which we do not talk about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aloysius Trenhaile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I suppose it might not work. That's a possibility. But, it's a better possibility than me going back into that castle and dying because I tried to destroy a monster five thousand times my strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selma didn't respond. She leaned her weight on her right hip and stared into the sky. Benjamin took one glance and thought he saw her muttering something. He couldn't understand what she was saying. And, he couldn't understand why it was so important that he save King Zwirn. Certainly, she did not know Benjamin nearly as well as Benjamin thought he knew himself.</p>

<p>Benjamin continued to walk and felt as if he was making really good time. At this rate, he could get back to the castle in just two days. It would be a difficult two days, he thought to himself, because it would probably be exhausting. But with the key, he thought, I've got all the motivation I need.</p>

<p>At the same moment Benjamin thought about how the key was motivating him to run back to the castle, Selma sprinted the distance between the two of them and then tackled Benjamin from behind. Benjamin flew about ten feet into the air and then fell into the ground, the key flying into the air. He was more surprised than hurt. In fact, Selma had tackled him in such a way that he was completely uninjured. He was simply shocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>Selma stood and pinned him to the ground. She held his arms down on his side and stared straight into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to save the king,&#8221; she said sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you think you should? You're obviously stronger than I am,&#8221; Benjamin said as he tried to wriggle free. It could not be done. Selma was definitely stronger and tougher than he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you are going to do it. I didn't come this far so that we can go back without the king. You are going to save him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why me? Why not you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I can't.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can't you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; Selma started as she closed her eyes. &#8220;I'll watch your back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew that she was not telling him everything that was running through her head. And, he also knew that he could not expect to make any further progress toward getting back to Castle Ehtahl. Selma was not going to allow it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Benjamin gulped. &#8220;I'll go die trying to save King Zwirn if that's what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's what I want,&#8221; Selma said as she released the boy. &#8220;But, you know, without the part of you dying. Please don't die in the castle. Don't die, in general. But, you know, please don't die while you're trying to save the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know how I'm going to survive,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just do your best,&#8221; Selma said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma, that's not inspiring. I don't know what that means. I'm really scared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should be scared. Aloysius Trenhaile is a gigantic monster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right! That's why I don't want to go see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Selma said with a more understanding tone. &#8220;I wouldn't want to either. But trust me, Benjamin. If you save the king, you'll be saving yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin and Selma walked back to Aloysius Trenhaile's castle without saying a word to each other. Benjamin's pace was much slower and much less enthusiastic than when he thought he was leaving. For Selma, he decided, he would save King Zwirn. If this was what she wanted and this was what would allow him to go home, this was what he would do.</p>

<p>He stood in front of the castle door that they had only recently exited and took a deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you need me, I'll be right here,&#8221; Selma said as she straightened her clothes and readjusted her backpack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; Benjamin replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck. And, don't die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Benjamin said as he lowered his head and walked through the door. He would not have bet on him being the winner of this outcome. As far as Benjamin was concerned, he was walking to the end of his life.</p>





















<h1 id="chapter28">Chapter 28: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Battle</h1>

<p>Benjamin climbed over the wall and then down the other side, without the same enthusiasm he had when he first entered the castle. He sighed when he saw that the army had erupted into all out frenzy. Skeletons were losing limbs. Trolls were stumbling over minotaurs. Ghosts were scaring each other. Dragons were flying into one another. And, lava was falling everywhere. Benjamin took a deep breathe and then let all the air out of his body through his vibrating lips. He was not excited, at all.</p>

<p>He walked through the mayhem and screams and yelling to the start of the staircase. Selma waited outside the castle and as Benjamin scaled the stairs, he saw her. She was watching his every move. And when Benjamin paused to take a break, he saw her waving to him. He waved back as a headless horseman ran by and fell off the staircase into the coal pile below. Benjamin continued his journey upwards as if nothing surprised him anymore.</p>

<p>When he got to the top, he could see that the nightmare machine had melted thoroughly enough to render it unusable. But, parts of it were still functioning and it looked like it was going to explode. Aloysius Trenhaile was giving orders to all of the beasts around him to save the machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't turn it off!&#8221; he screamed. &#8220;Keep it running and save every part!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aloysius!&#8221; Benjamin heard King Bernard Zwirn yell. &#8220;You have to stop this immediately. This is no way to behave, brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet!&#8221; Aloysius yelled. &#8220;If this doesn't work tonight, it'll work tomorrow. And, you'll witness it then!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, Benjamin pushed open the large door to the room which created a slow squealing noise that grabbed everyone's attention. In fact, as soon as Benjamin stood inside, he saw that every creature was looking at him. Aloysius Trenhaile dropped a box of tools on the ground upon seeing the young child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? You again? You came back? Did you drop something that you came back for?&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile asked. &#8220;You have to be so stupid in order to come back here. I let you free. I didn't chase after you. And now, what? What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin paused and twisted his foot into the ground. He let out a long sigh and thought really hard about why he had returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh you must be kidding me,&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile said with a chuckle. &#8220;You're here because you want to stop me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin continued to twist his foot in the ground and then he began stretching his arms. He wasn't sure what was going to happen next. Benjamin had never fought anyone in his life. He never wanted to fight anyone. It was not in his character. Through his entire life to date, he had always received the insults and punches. He never delivered them. And so, he didn't quite know what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aloysius Trenhaile!&#8221; Benjamin yelled. &#8220;Stop the nightmares now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloysius Trenhaile laughed. There was a long silence And then, all of the beasts around him laughed. And then, all of the beasts and nightmares throughout the castle laughed. But there were two people other than Benjamin who were not laughing. King Bernard Zwirn looked scared for Benjamin. And upon looking outside, Selma was still waving.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child, leave now before you get hurt,&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile said. &#8220;I don't think you know what you're getting yourself into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;I don't know what I'm getting myself into. But, I know that I want you to stop what you're doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if I don't?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I'm going to have to stop you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The roars of laughter spread throughout the castle over and over. Benjamin did not look like a threat. He knew this. He knew this his entire life. But all of that perception was going to change. If Aloysius Trenhaile was not going to stop, Benjamin wanted to stop him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright everyone,&#8221; Aloysius Trenhaile said to all the beasts. &#8220;Let's get back to saving this nightmare machine. Cool the rest of the melting sections and then--&#8221;</p>

<p>Aloysius Trenhaile continued to give instructions to his followers as Benjamin continued to stand there. Benjamin turned to King Bernard Zwirn and saw that he did not look as scared as he did moments before. Instead, the king clench his fist and held it in front of him to give Benjamin his sign of support. And so, Benjamin decided that it was time for him to take things into his own hands. Because if he was going to get hurt, he was willing to get hurt knowing that he could save dreamers like himself everywhere.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and upon opening his eyes watched a gigantic lava ball smash into the nightmare machine destroying everything that Aloysius Trenhaile was trying to preserve. Unlike before, the beasts and creatures did not respond with panic or confusion. Everyone looked at Benjamin who was imagining another lava ball falling into all of these demons.</p>

<p>With one quick motion, Aloysius Trenhaile pushed everyone away to the walls as a lava ball crashed into the room resulting in a fantastic explosion. Aloysius Trenhaile made a motion with his hands and froze the explosion as it occurred. Benjamin's jaw dropped as he watched Aloysius take the explosion and throw it thousands of feet in the air. They were fighting, Benjamin thought.</p>

<p>Benjamin imagined destroying the walls on all sides of the room so that they stood on only a floor on top of the tower. Aloysius responded by creating a large crack in the ground that splintered through Benjamin's feet. Benjamin jumped to the side and watched a chunk of the tower fall to the ground. He picked up some of the boulders and threw them one after another at Aloysius. Aloysius collected them in midair and then threw them back at Benjamin who ducked to the ground to avoid them. This was not going to be as easy as Benjamin thought. Aloysius could imagine things as well as Benjamin could.</p>

<p>And then, Aloysius did something that Benjamin did not expect. He transformed into a gigantic bull. Benjamin started to build a wall in front of him as quickly as he could. Aloysius breathed fire out of his snout and then proceeded to run forward. Benjamin built and built and built until the wall was twenty feet high and twenty feet thick. And still, Aloysius charged through it like it was a stack of cards. Benjamin fell to the ground and slid to the edge of the floor. He held on tightly so as not to fall off the tower.</p>

<p>He imagined a lightning bolt shattering the sky and hitting Aloysius square in the back. The bull squealed in pain and Aloysius transformed back into a human body. The evil man gathered a fire and set the entire floor ablaze. Benjamin responded by freezing everything around him and then freezing the entire top half of the tower. Aloysius roared in response and then transformed into a cyclops a dozen times larger than Benjamin. He grabbed a section of the building and slammed it over Benjamin. But Benjamin imagined himself in a solid sphere and the tower broke all around him. Aloysius charged and then created a sound wave with his hands that blew Benjamin off the tower.</p>

<p>Benjamin was in freefall and could feel that he was losing control. He spun every which direction and did not know how much further he had until he hit the ground. But then he imagined that like that day in the academy, he could fly. And so Benjamin returned to the top of the tower flying and imagined a tornado headed directly for Aloysius. Aloysius responded with a hail storm that absorbed the tornado and tried to suck Benjamin inside it.</p>

<p>Aloysius transformed into a dragon and began chasing Benjamin in the air while sending fireballs in his direction. Benjamin dodged each one and flew throughout the castle, trying to get away from the beast. He circled the tower over and over but Aloysius kept on his tail the entire way. Aloysius snapped at Benjamin with his teeth whenever he neared but Benjamin continued to avoid the monster. He imagined that Aloysius was stuck in an iron cage and when that cage appeared around the flying dragon, Aloysius fell to the ground with a thud loud enough to create another lava river running through the castle.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked down and thought that he did it. He had defeated Aloysius Trenhaile. The monster had fallen to its own demise. Benjamin quickly flew to the top of the tower to find King Bernard Zwirn. He was a little shaken but he was fine. Benjamin opened the cage and let him free.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Benjamin,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you OK?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the king said slowly. &#8220;I don't suppose anyone could say they felt OK after having survived what you and my brother just created. But, I'm fine. We have to leave, Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned to go and then Benjamin saw a sight that was familiar to him from long ago. When he was with his friends, the dinosaurs, trying to stop Professor Undutois from destroying the planet, there was a terrifying monster. It was a monster so feared that the dinosaurs ran from it. A monster that ruined his dreams and turned them into nightmares. And at that moment, Benjamin saw that same monster jump up the side of the tower and land at the very top.</p>

<p>The tower couldn't take the weight of this enormous beast. It swayed from side to side as another chunk of the tower fell to the ground. A crack rippled through the ground to the top floor. The monster looked at Benjamin and let out a roar so loud it could be heard throughout the entire land Benjamin had travelled. Benjamin couldn't hear. The noise was so deafening. And the resulting ringing in his ears made him dizzy. He looked around and saw that King Bernard Zwirn was holding his ears and laying on the ground. He was alive but like Benjamin in a lot of danger. The monster roared again and then snapped at Benjamin.</p>

<p>It wants to cut off my head, Benjamin thought.</p>

<p>As he thought about the last person who wanted to cut off his head, he thought he knew how to destroy this monster. But to do so, he would have to dream of something so massive that the beast couldn't stand a chance. And so, he transformed into a humongous white dragon.</p>

<p>Benjamin knew what he was going to do next. He flew into the air and Aloysius gave chase. They flew around the castle several times as Aloysius continued to try to grab and thrash at the white dragon.</p>

<p>Having been on a basket flown by a bird, he knew that one way to get the bird to fall to the ground was to hit it on the side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw something at him!&#8221; Benjamin yelled to King Bernard Zwirn as he flew by the top of the tower.</p>

<p>Benjamin led the monster around the top of the tower several times until he saw King Bernard Zwirn had a ball of fire ready to throw at it. When the king released it, the fire struck the beast in the side. And that alone was not enough to stop it. But, it reacted with confusion and pain. It shook the fire off its body but while it was doing so, Benjamin flew as fast as he could at the monster's eyes.</p>

<p>He needed to prevent the beast from being able to see.</p>

<p>And then, he remembered the coal.</p>

<p>He took as much coal as he could and thrust it at the monster's eyes. The beast screamed in pain and in the middle of the sky, it transformed back into Aloysius Trenhaile. Benjamin thought about letting Aloysius fall to the ground but seeing that he was unconscious, he grabbed him before he fell.</p>

<p>This was it.</p>

<p>At the top of the tower, King Bernard Zwirn restrained his brother who at that point was weakened and could no longer fight back.</p>

<p>The tower started to crumble. Benjamin took the king and Aloysius and flew them to where Selma stood outside the castle. As he flew over the wall, the tower completely collapsed and buried all of the monsters and nightmares that were living below. There was nothing left but walls that surrounded a gigantic mound of dust and lava.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, you're alive,&#8221; Selma said rather cooly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I survived,&#8221; Benjamin said as he lay on the grass, exhausted by it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to say I didn't think you could do it, but I'm a little impressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you're alive. I actually am quite impressed with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But did you really have to bring him back with you?&#8221; Selma asked as she pointed to the still unconscious Aloysius Trenhaile.</p>

<p>&#8220;We're taking him back with us,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said. &#8220;He won't be producing nightmares any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin reached inside his pocket and felt for a key. It was still there. Despite all of the flying and falling and fire and ice and lightning and earthquakes, he still managed to have the key. He could finally leave. And, he could finally leave knowing that Selma was happier with how he was leaving.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you and your brother grow so far apart?&#8221; Benjamin asked. &#8220;You make dreams and he makes nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn't always make nightmares,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said as they prepared themselves for the journey back to Castle Ehtahl. &#8220;No one wants to be evil. Something happens that makes good people do evil things. My brother originally made dreams. He made some of the most beautiful, inspiring dreams you could ever imagine for people. But one day, everything changed for him. He wanted something he couldn't have. And when he realized he couldn't have it, he started getting angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he want?&#8221; Selma asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted to always live in a dream. It's one thing to have dreams and be a dreamer. But, we can't live in our dreams. We have to accept that reality is separate from them. He couldn't understand it and he believed that there were people who lived in dreams. And since he was unable to live this way, he decided that no one else should either. That's when he joined the castles that produce nightmares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with him now?&#8221; Benjamin asked. &#8220;His castle's destroyed. He can't produce nightmares there anymore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can't but he could go somewhere else, if he wants. If I know my brother, he's as stubborn as I am. And so, I'd like to keep him in Castle Ehtahl for a while. I think if there's anyone who can convince him to change his ways, it'll be me. I can't send him back out into this land. The land will either kill him or he'll hurt others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin respected King Bernard Zwirn for not giving up on his brother. He thought it was commendable that he was going to try to change him to be good. At home, he didn't think most people behaved the same way.</p>

<p>&#8220;So now there's no more nightmares,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Selma started. &#8220;There's no more nightmares from Aloysius Trenhaile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's impossible to get rid of all the nightmares, Benjamin,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said as the sun started to rise in the distance. &#8220;So long as there are dreamers, there are going to be people who want to destroy dreams. The victory today is that there will be more dreams than nightmares. And for your New York, that means there will be dreams again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin watched the sun rise and felt that he was fine with this situation. He could dream again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let's go home,&#8221; King Bernard Zwirn said. &#8220;I'm exhausted.&#8221;</p>























<h1 id="chapter29">Chapter 29: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Guard</h1>

<p>When they returned to Castle Ehtahl's walls, Benjamin felt relief knowing that he had finally made it back. Selma and he were exhausted. Aloysius Trenhaile was still unconscious. But, King Bernard Zwirn seemed as energetic as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before we go inside,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;You should probably know that Thalia Nachamie is in charge and he isn't really fond of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't worry, Benjamin,&#8221; the king said. &#8220;I will clear up everything in the castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that's great,&#8221; Benjamin said as the king was about to pound on the wall. &#8220;Also, I was wondering if you could clear everything up at Castle Ehtsetra.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king froze and looked at Selma.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened at Castle Ehtsetra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing really but the queen there doesn't appear to like us either,&#8221; Selma said. &#8220;She wanted to cut Benjamin's head off.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king let out a loud sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, I'll clear that up as well,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Before he could pound on the door for the second time, Benjamin interrupted him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh also,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;You should probably talk to Myrna Delacourte.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king looked at Selma and Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you two been over the past week?&#8221; he asked with disbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;We've been to a lot of places. I've met a lot of people,&#8221; Benjamin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll clear it all up. You don't have to worry about a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn pounded on the castle wall as loudly as he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; Noel Jaffin asked on the other end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, this is King Zwirn. Let me in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I've been hearing that all week. Try something else, Dave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Noel, this is King Zwirn. Let me in this instant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, right. And, I'm five feet tall and cleanly shaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin stepped forward and pounded on the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, let us in!&#8221; Benjamin yelled as loudly as he could.</p>

<p>There was a pause on the other end. Benjamin could hear feet shuffling around and then a ladder being rested against the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin? Is that you?&#8221; Noel Jaffin whispered quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so you recognize Benjamin's voice but you don't recognize mine,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry about that, King Zwirn,&#8221; Noel Jaffin said as the doors to the castle began to open. &#8220;We've been getting so many visitors who claim to be you. Some of them sounded nearly identical to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of them did,&#8221; Cole said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly but they were certainly very close to how King Zwirn speaks,&#8221; Noel Jaffin defended himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of them were close,&#8221; Joel said with a long sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't say exactly but I'm saying that they could have been mistaken for King Zwirn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, you need to get your ears checked,&#8221; King Zwirn said as he reentered his castle.</p>

<p>Benjamin followed behind and was happy to be in a place that was more hospitable than some of the other places he had been. Selma walked at his side. He knew that she wanted to smile but that she was holding herself back.</p>

<p>Noel left Cole and Joel to close the door and stumbled his way to Bernard Zwirn's side. He was breathless as he tried to speak to the king.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; Noel blurted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was kidnapped, Noel,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said without looking at the sweaty guard. &#8220;But, now I'm back. And, I need to see Thalia Nachamie immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noel stopped working and looked to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why of course,&#8221; Noel said. &#8220;I'll go find him. But, what are we going to do with Benjamin?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn stopped walking and turned his head slightly to the side.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean what are we going to do with Benjamin?&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin saw that Noel was trying to keep the conversation private between the king and himself. Noel moved closer to Bernard Zwirn and stood on his toes so as to speak closer to the king's ear. Bernard Zwirn didn't move so Noel tried to speak as quietly as possible, while watching Benjamin in the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;He's a convicted villain,&#8221; Noel whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A convicted villain?&#8221; Bernard Zwirn blurted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh! He's right there,&#8221; Noel whispered back in a panic.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he been convicted of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stealing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he stolen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stole the missing piece of the dream machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, the dream machine now works?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it could. It doesn't, though. After Benjamin left, Thalia Nachamie told us that since it had not been used in such a long period of time, it was impossible to figure out where the missing piece actually went.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Thalia Nachamie is the one who convicted Benjamin of stealing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, he didn't steal it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Noel said slowly as he looked away shyly from Benjamin. &#8220;If you say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Noel, did anyone see Benjamin steal anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And don't you think it is odd that Thalia Nachamie didn't fix the machine? He kicked Benjamin from the castle and then did nothing with the missing piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that's not exactly true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What isn't true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Noel started to speak more slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kicked Benjamin out of the castle,&#8221; Pritchett Pollock said from behind Bernard Zwirn. &#8220;We had to find you. And so, I sent Benjamin to find you by having him be kicked out of the castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sent a child to find me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He's not just any child. He's got a larger imagination than any person I've ever met. His creativity is beyond my understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wanted me to find King Bernard Zwirn,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;Why didn't you just let me go outside like I wanted all along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you would have wanted to come back,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;And, we would have had to let you come back. We couldn't think of another way to find King Bernard Zwirn but for some reason, we all agreed that if anyone could find him, you could find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin was flabbergasted. He could not believe that this had been arranged. The sun beat steadily upon his face as his heart beat twice as fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I could have been killed out there. I had no idea where I was going and I had no idea what I was doing. What if I had gotten myself killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn't have,&#8221; Selma said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8221;As long as you were able to destroy your fears, you were going to be fine,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he did find me,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he was the only one who could possibly find you,&#8221; Pritchett Pollock said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in your favor, Benjamin,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said. &#8220;Because, we couldn't send you home without King Zwirn's assistance. He's the only one that can let you leave. You would have been stuck here forever unless you found him. There isn't a door outside the castle that takes you back to New York. There isn't a door here, either. The door opened when you defeated your nightmare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin realized at that moment that everything that he had gone through had been a result of his desire to leave. He helped others as he tried to help himself. And in the process, he saw that he was cared for and loved by friends he had known for only a short time.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, I can now go home?&#8221; Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said as he knelt down to the young boy. &#8220;You've done an amazing thing, Benjamin. No one else would have been able to do what you've done. You've given us the chance to dream again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Benjamin started to say as he glanced at Selma. &#8220;I don't really want to leave anymore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't want to leave?&#8221; Selma yelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't want to leave! You realize everything we did was to give you a chance to leave! And now, you don't want to leave?&#8221; Selma screamed.</p>

<p>Bernard Zwirn physically restrained the young girl from tackling Benjamin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's just that,&#8221; Benjamin said shyly. &#8220;I like it here. I want to see my parents. But, I like it here. I like you all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, great,&#8221; Selma said sarcastically. &#8220;He likes us now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do! I do like you. You are my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin,&#8221; King Zwirn said. &#8220;You need to go back and take care of your parents. And, you need to take care of your brother. If we are going to continue to make dreams, we need people to dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin looked at the ground and wondered how he could go back to New York now. He had been through so much that had made him happier and braver than he was before. But when he thought of his parents, he knew that the decision was not a difficult one. He had to go back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going to find Russell Fox,&#8221; Bernard Zwirn said. &#8220;When you are ready to leave, let me know Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We're going as well,&#8221; Miss Lindenmeyer said, referring to Pritchett Pollock. &#8220;We will see you soon. You can come back whenever you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bye, Benjamin,&#8221; Pritchett Pollock said. &#8220;Please try to keep your dreams a little less creative. You're stretching my budget.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin watched them leave and wondered when he would see them again. He wondered when he would see the production studios. And then, he wondered if he would ever see Snark again. Rodney! He never met Rodney Cohen and still did not know anything about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Benjamin said reluctantly. &#8220;I'll go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like that?&#8221; Selma said quietly. &#8220;You're not going to even fight to stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>He wasn't sure if he saw water well in her eyes or if she was squinting her face in anger, but in either case Selma looked hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, you just told me--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what I told you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I guess I expected that you'd spend a little over five minutes thinking about staying. But, you're ready to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my parents--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Selma said. &#8220;You should go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Selma--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selma!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin grabbed her and hugged her as hard as he could. He was hugging her so hard that he worried he had squeezed all of the air from her little body. He released her a little bit but when he felt Selma hug him back, he squeezed her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll miss you,&#8221; she said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll miss you, too,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you tell anyone I said that I'll kill you!&#8221; she yelled as she ran away.</p>

























<h1 id="chapter30">Chapter 30: Contains Words That May Or May Not Reveal That There Is A Dinosaur</h1>

<p>Mrs. Buckingham drove over a hundred miles an hour through the neighborhood, careful not to run into any pigeons and squirrels walking across the street. Her eyes were focused on the road like a racecar driver searching for a finish line. The news reporter on the radio was going on and on about the same story.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a report issued last night, people everywhere are dreaming again,&#8221; the reporter said. &#8220;The dreams are back and people are more confident than ever. For more on this story, we're turning to field reporter Rebecca--&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't understand why every morning has to be like this,&#8221; she said to Benjamin who sat silently in the passenger seat. Benjamin bounced the back of his head against his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't hear my alarm,&#8221; Benjamin said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that every morning,&#8221; Mrs. Buckingham said as she swerved around a group of squirrels fighting over a nut. &#8220;And every morning I have to race through the neighborhood giving all the little critters along the way heart attacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can be late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot be late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Billy comes in late almost every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren't Billy. You missed too much class already what with your having disappeared for so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin heard a pigeon scream as it narrowly missed being struck by their little car.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll make it up. No big deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No big deal? Benjamin, we still have to talk about where you were. This is a big deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Buckingham slammed on the brakes and stopped at a red light. Benjamin flew forward and nearly hit his head on the dashboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not like we learn anything at school anyways,&#8221; Benjamin said matter of factly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Buckingham stared at him with accusing eyes for about a minute. Benjamin didn't know why she didn't agree. He learned more in the past month than he had in all of his days in Mr. Marchetta's classroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin, I love you but sometimes you say the most ridiculous things. When you get home tonight, you have to tell me where you were for the past month,&#8221; his mother said as she accelerated the car faster and faster through New York.</p>

<p>Benjamin wondered how much easier it would have been to get to Aloysius Trenhaile's Castle if he had a car. He assumed, of course, that he knew how to drive. But based on how his mother was currently driving, he decided it could not be that difficult. He then wondered how much sooner he would have gotten home had he had roads to follow like the roads throughout his neighborhood. And then, he wondered how much further he could have travelled each day if there were lights scattered throughout to illuminate his path. There were things everywhere along this race to school that made Benjamin wonder whether he could have endured less in his voyage.</p>

<p>And at that moment when a squirrel jumped over the car to avoid Mrs. Buckingham's dash to the finish line, he knew that it would all be different. If he had things that could have made his journey easier, he would not have evolved from the boy who was scared of everything into the boy who was scared of a lot less.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bye, mom,&#8221; Benjamin said as he exited the car in front of the school as she waved goodbye and blew him a kiss.</p>

<p>The school looked the same. Nothing had changed. It had a boring exterior. The grass was barely alive. Kids trampled over each other to get through the door before the bell rang. It was exactly as it was. There was nothing different.</p>

<p>And, Benjamin loved that.</p>

<p>Because for the first time in his life, he knew that he was different.</p>

<p>And that meant that possibly, just possibly, he was not below average.</p>

<p>He sat in Mr. Marchetta's classroom as the teacher lectured over and over again about forests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forests have lots of animals in them. There are deer, birds, raccoons, all sorts of animals. The only animal you don't find in a forest is people. We don't live in forests. We live in cities. Forests don't have toilets or grocery stores or movie theaters. You think it's funny but if you ever decide to spend some time in a forest, you'll learn it's not an enjoyable place. You're going to want to leave. Forests are the worst. They are scary and ruthless and dangerous. There's nothing fun about a forest. But if you find yourself in a forest, make sure to mark trees with a rock as you walk. That way, you'll know how to exit. You just search for the trees that you marked. And then, you'll be on your way out unless...&#8221;</p>

<p>Benjamin stared out the window and watched a large billowing cloud takes its time moving along the blue canvas of the sky toward the golden sun resting above the buildings across the street. He saw Mr. Marchetta's fancy car parked outside the school. It was blue and looked like it would move much faster than his mother's car. He didn't like it. Part of the reason he didn't like it was because it was owned by Mr. Marchetta. But, the other part that he didn't like was that it looked out of place. He wanted to see a tree or a bush or a river or a volcano instead.</p>

<p>And then suddenly, Benjamin saw Snark appear from seemingly out of nowhere. Benjamin's heart raced and his eyes widened as he stretched his neck to see what Snark was going to do.</p>

<p>The ground vibrated with each step Snark took, pounding the pavement and rattling the windows. Snark paused and turned his gigantic head. Benjamin knew Snark was looking directly at him. Snark's mouth opened slightly to reveal his teeth and Benjamin saw him pant lightly like a dog when it's happy.</p>

<p>Benjamin grinned as well.</p>

<p>Snark lifted his left leg high into the air and then slammed it down into Mr. Marchetta's car. It made the same sound as when Benjamin stepped on an empty soda can. And since Benjamin liked that sound so much, it was impossible for him to not stop laughing.</p>

<p>Snark left as quickly as he arrived but not without waving to Benjamin beforehand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benjamin!&#8221; Mr. Marchetta yelled.</p>

<p>Benjamin covered his mouth and then turned to his teacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you a question! Why weren't you paying attention?&#8221; Mr. Marchetta asked with a stern, angry look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he still doesn't know where he is,&#8221; Howard Horne snickered from the back. &#8220;Benjamin's lost in the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The class, Howard Horne's audience, giggled in response. Mr. Marchetta started to laugh as well. Benjamin looked around and saw that he was the joke of everyone around him.</p>

<p>But unlike weeks ago when Benjamin was bullied and felt like there was nothing outside of that classroom for him, he knew that there was a big world ready to welcome him. </p> 
<p>He didn't need the bullies.</p>

<p>He had his friends.</p>

<p>And so, he smiled.</p>
